148619	and rate control with atrioventricular (AV) nodal blockers.	0
148618	"For patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), there are two main strategies to manage the irregular rhythm and its impact on symptoms: rhythm control (restoration followed by maintenance of sinus rhythm with either antiarrhythmic drugs or radiofrequency catheter ablation);"	1
148620	"For those patients in whom a rhythm control strategy is chosen, the main goal of therapy is to reduce symptoms by decreasing the frequency and duration of episodes as well as the symptoms during recurrences."	1
148621	"As antiarrhythmic drugs are associated with a potential for serious adverse side effects, particularly the induction of proarrhythmia, they should be prescribed only by practitioners familiar with their use."	0
148622	Patients should be fully informed of both the benefits and risks associated with the use of these drugs.	0
148623	Rhythm control can be achieved with either antiarrhythmic drug therapy or nonpharmacologic methods.	0
148624	This topic provides recommendations for the former.	0
148625	The clinical trials describing the efficacy and toxicity (including proarrhythmia) of the different antiarrhythmic drugs are presented separately.	0
148626	Nonpharmacologic methods to maintain sinus rhythm (including surgery and radiofrequency ablation) in selected patients who are refractory to conventional therapy are discussed elsewhere.	1
148627	"There are three settings in which a rhythm control strategy for the maintenance of sinus rhythm should be considered: Persistent symptoms (palpitations, dyspnea, lightheadedness, angina, syncope, and heart failure) despite adequate rate control."	0
148628	An inability to attain adequate rate control (to prevent tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy).	0
148629	Patient preference.	0
148630	Some patients will strongly prefer to avoid either paroxysmal or persistent AF.	0
148631	"We consider cardioversion to sinus rhythm in most patients, particularly younger patients, with a first-detected episode of AF in whom the arrhythmia is of recent onset and the risk for recurrence appears to be low."	1
148632	Maintenance antiarrhythmic drug therapy is not routinely used after cardioversion in patients with newly detected AF.	1
148633	These issues are discussed in detail separately.	0
148634	"Prior to selecting and initiating antiarrhythmic drug therapy, the following issues should be considered."	0
148635	"The choice between a rhythm- or a rate-control strategy is determined by many factors, including patient age, the degree to which symptoms interfere with the quality of life, and concerns about antiarrhythmic drug therapy or radiofrequency catheter ablation."	0
148636	"There is no evidence that long-term outcomes, such as rates of survival or thromboembolism, are improved by rhythm control."	0
148637	Our recommendations for the use of these two strategies are found elsewhere.	0
148638	"Before initiating a rhythm control strategy, any risk factors for AF should be addressed."	0
148639	"Examples include hyperthyroidism, hypertension, heart failure, and excess alcohol intake."	0
148640	"Maintenance antiarrhythmic drug therapy is not recommended after cardioversion in a patient with a transient or reversible cause (such as cardiac surgery, pericarditis, or pulmonary embolism)."	1
148641	"An option in such patients is beta blocker therapy after restoration of sinus rhythm, which may provide modest protection against recurrent AF."	0
148642	"However, short-term antiarrhythmic therapy can be considered in this situation as the underlying cause is treated in patients who are highly symptomatic."	1
148643	Chronic anticoagulation is required with either rhythm or rate control in most patients.	0
148644	An exception to this need for maintenance anticoagulation occurs in patients without structural heart disease who are at low risk for embolization;	1
148645	such patients can be treated with no long-term antithrombotic therapy.	0
148646	"However, anticoagulation is required for at least three weeks prior to, during, and for at least four weeks after cardioversion in patients with AF duration of longer than 48 hours."	1
148647	"After four weeks of anticoagulation, individuals who do not require long-term anticoagulation can discontinue the medication."	1
148648	"An atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocker is usually started before, or simultaneously with, antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients who have demonstrated a moderate to rapid ventricular rate (>=110 beats per minute) during AF."	1
148649	Slowing of the rate generally improves symptoms prior to the restoration of sinus rhythm.	0
148650	This therapy is continued while the patient is in sinus rhythm to protect against a rapid ventricular rate (greater than 110 bpm) should AF recur.	0
148651	"A beta blocker, or rate-slowing calcium channel blocker such as verapamil or diltiazem, is often used if there are no contraindications, since the withdrawal of vagal tone and increase in sympathetic tone with exercise often render digoxin relatively ineffective for controlling the heart rate."	0
148652	"Beta blockers may be preferred, since they also modestly protect against recurrence of AF."	0
148653	"Although verapamil may protect against AF-induced electrical remodeling, it has not been shown to prevent recurrence of AF during long-term follow-up."	0
148654	"On the other hand, digoxin is often used in patients with AF associated with systolic heart failure because of its beneficial effect on symptom control."	1
148655	Such patients are also typically treated with a beta blocker because of the associated improvement in survival.	0
148656	The negative inotropic activity of calcium channel blockers makes them less desirable in such patients.	0
148657	"In addition, AV nodal blockade is useful to prevent a 1:1 response should atrial flutter occur after cardioversion or when class IA or IC drugs are used."	0
148658	"Class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as flecainide, may suppress most, but not all, reentrant circuits."	0
148659	"Although the atrial myocardium may not be capable of sustaining AF in this setting, it may be able to generate and sustain atrial flutter."	0
148660	"In addition, the profound sodium channel blocking effects of the class IC drugs can markedly slow atrial conduction, making atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction a significant risk."	0
148661	The possible role of angiotensin inhibition to prevent recurrent AF is discussed elsewhere.	0
148662	Many patients with AF in whom a rhythm control strategy is chosen will need sinus rhythm restored prior to the initiation of long-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy.	1
148663	The restoration of sinus rhythm is discussed in detail elsewhere.	0
148664	Some patients with relatively infrequent episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can be managed with antiarrhythmic therapy given only at the time of the episode.	1
148665	"This form of outpatient ""pill-in-the-pocket"" therapy for recurrent AF is discussed separately."	0
148666	"Once the issues discussed above have been addressed, an antiarrhythmic agent can be chosen."	0
148667	The choice of drug is significantly influenced both by drug and patient characteristics.	0
148668	"As with all therapeutic interventions, the choice of agent should take into account the benefit to risk ratio of the therapy chosen."	0
148669	"Amiodarone, dofetilide, flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, and less commonly dronedarone are the drugs we recommend to maintain sinus rhythm."	0
148670	"For additional information regarding the therapeutic use of these drugs, including information regarding dosing and side effects, the reader is referred to individual UpToDate topics on these drugs or to the individual drug monographs in our drug database."	0
148671	"The following points regarding antiarrhythmic drugs should be kept in mind in choosing therapy: Compared to other agents, amiodarone is associated with the greatest likelihood of maintaining sinus rhythm, but also with the highest risk of long-term complications."	0
148672	"Quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide are no longer recommended for patients with AF, except perhaps in patients with vagally mediated AF, as there are more effective drugs and due to extracardiac side effects as well as the concern about proarrhythmia."	1
148673	"Beta blockers are modestly effective in maintaining sinus rhythm and can be tried first in selected patients, such as those without structural heart disease who are concerned about proarrhythmia."	1
148674	Of course beta blockers may have already been initiated to slow the ventricular rate in AF.	0
148675	"The following patient characteristics may influence decision making: The clinical features of the patient, such as presence or absence of clinical heart disease )."	1
148676	"We believe it is prudent to obtain a two-dimensional echocardiogram to screen for structural heart disease (eg, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, or valvular heart disease)."	0
148677	An exercise or nuclear stress imaging test may be used to screen for coronary heart disease and is typically done before starting a class IC agent.	0
148678	The presence of paroxysmal compared to persistent AF.	0
148679	"As examples, our experts rarely use dofetilide for paroxysmal AF and infrequently choose dronedarone for persistent AF due to reduced efficacy compared with amiodarone."	0
148680	The presence of vagally-mediated AF.	0
148681	"The 2010 European Society of Cardiology and the 2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology guidelines suggest that, because of its long-lasting anticholinergic activity, disopyramide may be considered in patients with vagally-induced AF (eg, occurring most often in athletic young men with slow heart rates during rest or sleep), as long as the patient does not have prostatism or glaucoma."	1
148682	The combination of disopyramide and either a beta blocker or a calcium channel blocker must be used cautiously because of the additive negative inotropic effects.	0
148683	"If disopyramide cannot be given or is not tolerated, flecainide and amiodarone represent the sequential alternatives."	0
148684	Propafenone is not recommended because its weak intrinsic beta blocking activity may aggravate vagally-induced paroxysmal AF.	0
148685	Our experts use disopyramide cautiously due to concern for proarrhythmia.	0
148686	"For patients with adrenergically-mediated AF (eg, occurring during exercise or other activity), we suggest beta blockers as first-line therapy, followed by sotalol and amiodarone."	1
148687	"Antiarrhythmic drugs are associated with a potential for serious adverse side effects, particularly the induction of proarrhythmia."	0
148688	"Thus, they should be prescribed only by practitioners familiar with their use."	0
148689	Patients should be fully informed of both the benefits and risk associated with the use of these drugs.	0
148690	"As the expectation of antiarrhythmic therapy is to reduce the frequency and duration of episodes, improve quality of life, and prevent hospitalization, a recurrence of AF does not necessarily denote a failure of the medication or mandate a change to a different antiarrhythmic drug."	0
148691	Patients without structural heart disease include those with hypertension who do not have left ventricular hypertrophy.	1
148692	"The author and reviewers of this topic generally select flecainide as the first antiarrhythmic drug for these patients due to its relatively good side effect profile, efficacy, and ease of use."	0
148693	"In these patients, flecainide, propafenone, amiodarone, dronedarone, sotalol, and dofetilide are superior to placebo for maintaining sinus rhythm."	0
148694	"For those patients in whom flecainide will not be used as the preferred agent, the following points can influence the choice of antiarrhythmic drug in patients without structural heart disease: In the Canadian Trial of Atrial fibrillation, AFFIRM, and the SAFE-T randomized trials, amiodarone was more effective than flecainide, propafenone, or sotalol (which have nearly equivalent efficacy to each other), but has a significantly higher rate of adverse side effects."	1
148695	"In a meta-analysis of trials where the effect of amiodarone versus dronedarone was estimated with the use of indirect comparison and normal logistic meta-analysis models, amiodarone was found to be more effective in maintaining sinus rhythm, but at the expense of greater drug discontinuation secondary to adverse events."	0
148696	Both amiodarone and dronedarone are associated with significant side effects.	0
148697	We suggest carefully discussing these with the patient prior to initiating therapy.	0
148698	"In the EMERALD trial, Dofetilide had a somewhat better efficacy than sotalol."	0
148699	Propafenone may have less proarrhythmia than flecainide.	0
148700	"Some cardiologists prefer to use low-dose amiodarone (200 mg per day) in preference to flecainide, sotalol, or dronedarone for two principal reasons: greater efficacy than sotalol and dronedarone, and a very low incidence of torsades de pointes."	0
148701	"In addition, since amiodarone has beta blocking and calcium channel blocking activity, the ventricular rate is usually slower and better tolerated if AF does recur."	0
148702	"If amiodarone is used for rhythm control, the need for additional medications to control rate (eg, beta blockers or calcium channel blockers) may be decreased."	0
148703	"Despite these advantages, low-dose amiodarone still has appreciable toxicity, including thyroid disease, hepatic dysfunction, lung disease, neurologic abnormalities, and bradycardia."	0
148704	"Amiodarone, sotalol, and dofetilide are the most commonly recommended first-line drugs in patients with structural heart disease."	1
148705	Our authors and reviewers prefer either dronedarone or sotalol to amiodarone and dofetilide.	0
148706	"Dronedarone is easier to use than sotalol (continuous monitoring of initiation required), but is less efficacious."	0
148707	"These drugs (with the exception of dronedarone) were used for initial therapy in almost 70 percent of patients in AFFIRM, 88 percent of whom had organic heart disease and/or hypertension."	1
148708	"Amiodarone was significantly more effective than sotalol in the CTAF, AFFIRM, and SAFE-T trials."	0
148709	"However, in SAFE-T, sotalol was as effective as amiodarone in the subgroup of patients with coronary heart disease."	1
148710	"In patients with coronary heart disease who do not have heart failure, sotalol, dronedarone, dofetilide, and amiodarone are acceptable choices."	1
148711	We prefer sotalol due to its better extracardiac side effect profiles.	0
148712	Flecainide and propafenone are contraindicated in this population.	0
148713	"In the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) of patients with drug-suppressible ventricular premature beats in the year following a myocardial infarction, flecainide increased mortality compared to placebo."	1
148714	"Although propafenone was not used in CAST and may not have the same potential for proarrhythmia as flecainide and encainide, it cannot be recommended in patients with underlying heart disease."	1
148715	"The extension of this concern to structural heart disease other than coronary artery disease stems in part from the flecainide clinical and safety database, which was used in a retrospective study demonstrating that the presence of structural heart disease including valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, and cardiomyopathies lead to an alarming increase in proarrhythmia and death."	0
148716	"Amiodarone and dofetilide, are used in patients with AF and HF or those with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35 percent."	1
148717	Our authors and reviewers are more comfortable using dofetilide in this setting with an implantable defibrillator in place or in younger patients with less severe impairment of left ventricular systolic function.	1
148718	This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere.	0
148719	"Sotalol, propafenone, and flecainide should not be used in patients with heart failure, due to studies showing an increase in mortality with these agents."	1
148720	"Patients with significant left ventricular hypertrophy (defined as left ventricular wall thickness greater 1.4 cm for the purposes of this discussion) due to hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or aortic stenosis have underlying subendocardial ischemia and electrophysiologic abnormalities."	1
148721	These increase the risk for proarrhythmia with antiarrhythmic agents.	0
148722	"Sotalol, flecainide and propafenone are thought to have a significant arrhythmic risk in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)."	1
148723	Dronedarone has been evaluated in patients with LVH and is thought to be relatively safe.	1
148724	Amiodarone is another therapeutic option.	0
148725	Some patients are refractory to individual antiarrhythmic agents plus an AV nodal blocker or develop side effects on doses necessary for arrhythmia prevention.	0
148726	"Although some have suggested that combination antiarrhythmic drug therapy (eg, a class IC agent with sotalol or amiodarone, often in lower doses) may be an alternative, there are limited data to support such an approach and the patient may be exposed to a greater risk of proarrhythmia and other side effects."	0
148727	"As a result, combination antiarrhythmic drug therapy is not recommended."	0
148728	"Such patients can be treated with a rate control strategy or referred for nonpharmacologic therapy to prevent recurrent AF including surgery (such as the maze operation), radiofrequency ablation (such as pulmonary vein isolation), or an implantable atrial defibrillator."	0
148729	Many patients begun on antiarrhythmic drug therapy should be hospitalized for continuous electrocardiographic monitoring due to a 10 to 15 percent incidence of adverse cardiac events during the initiation of therapy.	1
148730	The two complications of greatest concern are bradycardia and proarrhythmia.	0
148731	"Other adverse cardiac events can include significant QT prolongation, heart failure, rapid ventricular rate, conduction abnormalities, hypotension, and stroke."	0
148732	The risk is greatest in the first 24 hours and in patients with a prior myocardial infarction.	1
148733	"Outpatient initiation of antiarrhythmic drug therapy with the following agents may be considered: Flecainide or propafenone in patients in sinus rhythm who have no underlying structural heart disease, normal baseline QT intervals, and no profound bradycardia or suspected sinus or AV node dysfunction."	1
148734	"Amiodarone or dronedarone in selected patients who have no other risk factors for torsades de pointes (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) or sinus node dysfunction or AV conduction disease."	1
148735	Dronedarone and amiodarone are the only two drugs that can be initiated in outpatients while in atrial fibrillation.	1
148736	"Patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) represent another group in which outpatient initiation of therapy can be tried, since the ICD provides protection against the risks associated with bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias."	1
148737	"However, one should be cognizant of the potential effects of antiarrhythmic drugs on ventricular defibrillation threshold and ventricular tachycardia cycle length, which could influence the efficacy of ICD therapy."	0
148738	The initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with paroxysmal AF while they are in sinus rhythm is also associated with some risk.	1
148739	"In a review of 409 outpatient initiation trials for a history of recurrent AF or atrial flutter, adverse cardiac events occurred in 17 (4.5 percent);"	1
148740	"these included three deaths, three permanent pacemakers for bradycardia, and 11 dose reductions for bradycardia."	0
148741	"Inpatient initiation with continuous telemetry of higher-risk drugs such as dofetilide and sotalol is typically done over a course of three days, which encompasses five half-lives allowing for achievement of steady-state plasma concentrations."	1
148742	Recurrent AF should not necessarily be labeled as treatment failure.	0
148743	"Some patients will elect to continue drug therapy (and, in some cases, occasional cardioversion) because the arrhythmia burden has been substantially reduced as evidenced by episodes that are less frequent, shorter, or associated with milder symptoms."	0
148744	Nonpharmacologic therapies are another option in such patients.	0
148745	"If a patient has unacceptable recurrent AF on one antiarrhythmic drug, the drug is discontinued and another (and on rare occasion a third) agent is tried."	0
148746	"The starting and maintenance doses for amiodarone, dronedarone, propafenone, flecainide, sotalol, disopyramide, and dofetilide are found in respective LexiComp drug monographs available in UpToDate."	0
148747	"Many factors including age, sex, weight, renal or hepatic function, and characteristics on the electrocardiogram influence the starting dose for many of these."	0
148748	The use of antiarrhythmic drugs is associated with possible life-threatening side effects.	0
148749	The greatest concerns with these agents are proarrhythmia (and consequent tachyarrhythmia) and bradycardia.	0
148750	"Patients should be instructed to report symptoms suggestive of the development of drug related arrhythmias, such as syncope, lightheadedness or dizzy spells, or worsening exercise intolerance."	0
148751	"A 2012 meta-analysis of 56 studies (20,771 patients) compared one or more antiarrhythmic drugs to control or to each other."	0
148752	"Compared to controls, the use of the class IA antiarrhythmics quinidine and disopyramide (odds ratio 2.39, 95% CI 1.03-5.59) or sotalol (2.47, 95% CI 1.2-5.05) was associated with increased all-cause mortality, whereas the use of amiodarone, dronedarone, and dofetilide was not (odds ratios were not calculated for flecainide or propafenone)."	0
148753	"All antiarrhythmics studied showed increased pro-arrhythmic effects (counting both bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias attributable to treatment), with the exceptions of amiodarone, dronedarone, and propafenone."	0
148754	"All of the antiarrhythmic drugs used to maintain sinus rhythm have the potential to increase ectopy or induce or aggravate monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), torsades de pointes, or ventricular fibrillation (VF);"	0
148755	this is referred to as proarrhythmia.	0
148756	"In addition to its baseline potential to predispose the patient to proarrhythmia, a drug that is initially safe may become proarrhythmic when the patient develops coronary heart disease or heart failure or is treated with other medications that in combination may be arrhythmogenic."	1
148757	"Thus, the patient should be alerted to the potential significance of symptoms such as syncope and dyspnea and warned about the use of noncardiac drugs that can prolong the QT interval."	0
148758	"We agree with the following recommendations made according to drug class in the 2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology guideline: With type IC drugs, QRS widening should not be permitted to exceed 150 percent of the baseline QRS duration."	0
148759	Exercise testing may detect QRS widening that occurs only at rapid heart rates (use-dependent conduction slowing).	0
148760	Exercise testing is also a useful way to screen for exercise-induced proarrhythmia and is typically performed one to two weeks after drug initiation.	0
148761	"For type IA or type III drugs, with the possible exception of amiodarone, the corrected QT interval in sinus rhythm should remain below 520 milliseconds."	0
148762	More specific and conservative recommendations are available for dofetilide in the package insert.	0
148763	"During follow-up, serum creatinine, potassium, and magnesium concentrations should be monitored periodically because proarrhythmia is increased by renal insufficiency, which can lead to drug accumulation, hyperkalemia, and hypermagnesemia."	0
148764	The presence of renal insufficiency warrants dose reduction or cessation of sotalol and dofetilide.	0
148765	"In comparison, amiodarone is metabolized in the liver and dose adjustment is probably necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction."	1
148766	"Amiodarone and dronedarone can cause both sinus bradycardia and AV nodal block, with an overall incidence of bradycardic events of about 5 percent."	0
148767	"Sotalol, like other beta blockers, can also cause bradycardia."	0
148768	"In some cases, permanent pacemaker placement is necessary to permit continued use of these agents."	0
148769	"Our authors and reviewers have differing thresholds for the use of ambulatory monitoring to screen for proarrhythmia and bradycardia, ranging from screening in the highest risk cases only to screening in everyone."	0
148770	"Some experts suggest screening all patients with an ambulatory event monitor for at least two weeks after initiation of therapy, looking for QT interval prolongation or bradyarrhythmias."	1
148771	The basis for this recommendation is that many events occur after three days.	0
148772	"For those experts who are more selective based on patient risk, high-risk is defined as baseline bradycardia or borderline QT prolongation, heart failure, or systolic left ventricular dysfunction."	0
148773	"Others perform routine monitoring when sotalol, flecainide, or propafenone are chosen."	0
148774	Dofetilide must be initiated in a setting with continuous monitoring.	0
148775	"For those patients who are not referred for ambulatory monitoring, we suggest that a 12-lead electrocardiogram be obtained after the initiation of antiarrhythmic drug therapy."	1
148776	"Based on concerns about drug related arrhythmias and the observation that the atrial action potential normalizes after two to four weeks of sinus rhythm (after AF), the concept that short-term therapy might be as effective and safer than long-term therapy has been proposed."	0
148777	"This concept was tested in the Flec-SL non-inferiority trial, which randomly assigned 554 patients with persistent AF and who were intended to undergo cardioversion to either four weeks or six months of flecainide (200 to 300 mg per day)."	1
148778	All patients had successful restoration of sinus rhythm and were then followed with daily telemetric electrocardiography (and Holter monitoring whenever AF was noted on two ECGs) for six months.	0
148779	"The primary outcome of time to persistent AF or death occurred in 46 and 39 percent of patients, respectively, which did not meet the criteria of non-inferiority."	0
148780	"In addition, a post-hoc analysis of patients who had not reached the primary endpoint in the first month found long-term therapy to be superior (Kaplan-Meier estimate of difference 14.3 percent; hazard ratio 0.3; p = 0.0001)."	1
148781	We do not consider short-term therapy appropriate for most patients with persistent AF.	1
148782	"Patients with severe HF (generally those with NYHA class III or IV HF, or those who have been hospitalized with HF in the past four weeks) or those with an ejection fraction of <35 percent should not receive dronedarone."	1
148783	"The Permanent Atrial fibriLLAtion outcome Study (PALLAS) was designed to test the hypothesis that dronedarone would improve major outcomes in 10,000 patients with permanent AF, over 70 percent of whom had New York Heart Association heart failure class I to III or left ventricular systolic dysfunction at baseline."	1
148784	"The rationale was that patients with permanent AF, which affects up to 50 percent of patients with AF, have an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes including death and myocardial infarction as well as systemic embolization."	1
148785	The ATHENA trial showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular events with dronedarone in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF.	1
148786	Patients in PALLAS were treated with standard therapies for AF and then randomly assigned to dronedarone or placebo.	1
148787	"The study was stopped early (3236 patients enrolled), after a significantly increased risk (Hazard Ratio 2.29, 95% CI 1.34-3.94) of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke and systemic embolism) was observed in the dronedarone arm."	0
148788	"The individual secondary end points of stroke, death from cardiovascular causes, and hospitalization for heart failure were also significantly increased in the dronedarone group."	0
148789	The European Medicines Agency and the United States Food and Drug Agency (USFDA) have advised against the use of dronedarone in patients with permanent AF.	1
148790	"In addition, the USFDA now recommends that people taking the drug should have an electrocardiogram every three months to make sure that AF has not become permanent."	1
148791	"For patients taking dronedarone, routine monitoring of lung and liver function is not mandated by the USFDA;"	1
148792	"however, periodic monitoring may be reasonable."	0
148793	Our recommendations for the use of antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with AF are generally in agreement with the 2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC) guidelines on AF and the 2010 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on AF.	1
148794	"The 2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC) guidelines recommend propafenone, flecainide, and sotalol as first-line drugs to maintain sinus rhythm after cardioversion in patients without structural heart disease;"	1
148795	amiodarone and dofetilide can also be given as second-line agents.	0
148796	The 2010 ESC guidelines and the ACC/AHA/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) 2011 focused update on atrial fibrillation management have added dronedarone as another alternative first-line agent.	0
148797	"These drugs are generally better tolerated and perhaps safer than the class IA drugs, such as quinidine, which were widely used in the past."	0
148798	"Because of concerns about toxicity, the 2006 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines recommend that the use of amiodarone as a first-line therapy for maintenance of sinus rhythm should be reserved for patients with heart failure, moderate-to-severe systolic dysfunction, or hypertension with substantial left ventricular hypertrophy."	1
148799	"UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."""	0

148808	"For those patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in whom a rhythm-control strategy is chosen, the principal goal is to reduce symptoms by decreasing the frequency and duration of episodes."	1
148809	"Prior to selecting and initiating antiarrhythmic drug therapy, issues of precipitating factors, anticoagulation, and rate control should be addressed."	0
148810	"The following points should be kept in mind when considering antiarrhythmic drug therapy to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with AF: Beta blockers are modestly effective in maintaining sinus rhythm and can be tried first in selected patients, such as those without structural heart disease who are concerned about proarrhythmia."	1
148811	"Compared to placebo, amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, dronedarone, flecainide, and propafenone are effective for the maintenance of sinus rhythm, but maintenance rates at one year are significantly less than 75 percent."	0
148812	Amiodarone is consistently more effective than the other antiarrhythmic drugs.	0
148813	The primary-efficacy endpoint of most clinical trials involving antiarrhythmic drugs has been time to first recurrence of AF or percent of patients in sinus rhythm at the end of one year.	1
148814	"However, there is great variation in efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs from patient to patient."	0
148815	"Although a drug may be shown to significantly prolong the time to recurrence of AF in a clinical trial, individual patients may experience no benefit or experience a dramatic reduction in AF frequency."	0
148816	"Also, a single recurrence of AF on an antiarrhythmic drug does not necessarily indicate treatment failure or require a change in therapy."	0
148817	"In addition to less-than-optimal efficacy, serious drug-related adverse side effects limit the use of these drugs."	0
148818	Antiarrhythmic drug therapy should be prescribed only by practitioners familiar with their use.	0
148819	Patients should be fully informed of both the benefits and risks associated with the use of these drugs.	0
148820	"Based upon the potential for drug toxicity in the form of induced bradycardia or tachycardia, many patients will need to be hospitalized for continuous electrocardiographic monitoring."	0
148821	Dofetilide must be initiated in a setting with continuous monitoring.	0
148822	We make the following recommendations for the choice of antiarrhythmic drug to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with AF.	1
148823	"For patients with no structural heart disease and no apparent risk for drug-induced bradycardia or tachycardia, we suggest flecainide as the preferred antiarrhythmic drug."	1
148824	"Amiodarone, dofetilide, dronedarone, propafenone, or sotalol may be used, with the latter two chosen more often by our authors and reviewers."	0
148825	Practitioners should choose only those agents with which they have significant familiarity.	0
148826	"For patients with coronary artery disease who do not have advanced heart failure, we suggest dronedarone or sotalol in preference to amiodarone."	1
148827	Amiodarone is a reasonable choice in patients who prefer its greater efficacy despite its worse extracardiac side-effect profile.	1
148828	"For patients with heart failure, we suggest amiodarone in preference to dofetilide."	1
148829	"Flecainide, propafenone, dronedarone, and sotalol are contraindicated in these patients."	0
148830	"For patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, either amiodarone or dronedarone is generally preferred to other antiarrhythmic agents."	1
148831	"Our authors and reviewers have differing approaches, with some choosing amiodarone more often and others choosing dronedarone more often."	0
148832	"After the initiation of antiarrhythmic drug therapy, screening for drug-associated arrhythmia with ambulatory monitoring should be considered, particularly for patients at high risk of drug-induced arrhythmia."	1
148833	"This includes those with baseline bradycardia or borderline QT prolongation, heart failure, or systolic left ventricular dysfunction."	0
153955	"Heart failure is estimated to affect 12,000 to 35,000 children below the age of 19 years in the United States each year."	1
153956	It results from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle(s) to fill with or eject blood.	0
153957	The management of children with heart failure will be presented here.	1
153958	"The etiology, presentation, diagnosis, and initial evaluation of the pediatric patient with heart failure are discussed separately."	1
153959	"Because heart failure is a common clinical condition in adults, there is a substantial amount of evidence-based data based on large, placebo-controlled clinical trials that guide management."	0
153960	"Over the past 20 years, management of heart failure in adults has shifted based on observations that heart failure and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction activate sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems."	0
153961	"This response is initially physiologic (and compensatory), but persistent activation is maladaptive and contributes to progressive LV dilation and dysfunction (remodeling) and worsening heart failure."	0
153962	Data from clinical trials have shown that drugs targeted to block the effects of neuro-hormonal activation not only reverse LV remodeling but also improve survival in patients with heart failure.	1
153963	"However, the ability to conduct similar trials in children is not possible because the much lower prevalence rate of pediatric heart failure does not allow for a sufficient number of patients to replicate these studies."	0
153964	"As a result, treatment of heart failure in children is based on results provided by adult studies."	0
153965	This approach is justifiable because children in heart failure have neuro-hormonal changes and systemic ventricular remodeling similar to that described in adults with heart failure.	1
153966	"In 2004, the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) published guidelines for the treatment of heart failure in children primarily based on the adult literature."	1
153967	"Modifications for specific pediatric diagnoses were recommended based on expert consensus that was largely informed by clinical experience, small case series, and physiological studies."	0
153968	The management approach for this review is based on these guidelines and advances in heart failure therapy since the publication of these guidelines.	0
153969	"Therapeutic goals for children with heart failure are to relieve symptoms, decrease morbidity (including the risk of hospitalization), slow the progression of heart failure, and improve patient survival."	1
153970	The management of pediatric heart failure is dependent on its etiology and severity.	0
153971	Management begins with a thorough assessment of the underlying cause of heart failure.	0
153972	The causes of pediatric heart failure can be divided into pathophysiologic categories ).	0
153973	This categorization helps guide the approach to management.	0
153974	Heart failure due to ventricular pump dysfunction - Ventricular pump dysfunction and reduced ventricular contractility lead to impaired ejection of blood from the ventricle.	0
153975	Ventricular systolic dysfunction may occur in children with structurally normal hearts or in those with congenital heart disease.	1
153976	Medical pharmacologic therapy is generally the primary intervention.	0
153977	"Drug choice is dependent on the severity of heart failure and may include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, digoxin, and beta-blockers."	0
153978	"In patients with advanced heart failure refractory to pharmacologic therapy, interventions such as positive pressure ventilation, mechanical circulatory support, and heart transplantation may be considered."	1
153979	"Heart failure due to volume overload with preserved ventricular pump function - Volume overload (increased preload) may occur due to a significant left-to-right shunt from the systemic to the pulmonary circulation (eg, ventricular septal defect or atrioventricular canal defects) or, less commonly, due to valvular insufficiency."	0
153980	Surgical or catheter-based interventions to correct these defects lead to resolution of heart failure.	0
153981	Medical therapy may be needed for stabilization or symptom relief while awaiting a more definitive intervention.	0
153982	"Heart failure due to pressure overload with preserved ventricular pump function - Pressure overload (increased afterload) may lead to heart failure if severe ventricular outflow obstruction impedes ejection of blood from the heart resulting in inadequate cardiac output (eg, aortic stenosis), or if ventricular hypertrophy due to prolonged pressure overload results in high filling pressures and congestion (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)."	0
153983	Surgical or catheter-based interventions to correct these defects lead to resolution of heart failure.	0
153984	Medical therapy may be needed for stabilization or symptom relief while awaiting a more definitive intervention.	0
153985	"The management of pediatric heart failure is dependent on the severity of heart failure, which is defined by a staging system (stages A to D) developed by a writing committee on behalf of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), and modified for children by the ISHLT."	0
153986	"This schema identifies asymptomatic patients in the early stages of heart failure (ie, stage B) in whom early intervention, such as ACE inhibitors, may prolong the symptom-free state, as well as determine which patients require more aggressive therapy."	1
153987	Components of therapy for children with heart failure include the following: Identification and correction of noncardiac factors that contribute to cardiac dysfunction.	1
153988	"In the acute setting, these may include acidosis and sepsis."	0
153989	"Other factors that may be associated with either acute or chronic heart failure include anemia, hypertension, and renal failure."	0
153990	"Surgical or catheter-based interventions to correct the underlying structural defect (eg, significant left-to-right shunt or ventricular outflow obstruction)."	0
153991	"Pharmacologic therapy to relieve symptoms, slow the progression of ventricular dysfunction, and improve patient survival."	0
153992	"Additional therapeutic interventions for patients with advanced heart failure refractory to pharmacologic therapy include positive pressure ventilation, mechanical circulatory support, and heart transplantation."	1
153993	Nonpharmacologic therapy for chronic heart failure includes optimal nutrition and exercise rehabilitation.	0
153994	"Therapeutic interventions to reduce the risk of and/or treat associated complications (eg, thromboembolism, arrhythmias, and ventricular dyssynchrony)."	0
153995	"Surgical or catheter-based intervention can lead to resolution of heart failure in patients with either volume or pressure overload, and preserved ventricular function )."	1
153996	"Volume overload is associated with lesions with significant left-to-right shunting (eg, large ventricular septal defects and atrioventricular canal defects), whereas pressure overload is seen in patients with ventricular outlet obstruction (eg, critical aortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta)."	1
153997	Pharmacologic therapy is primarily used in patients with ventricular pump dysfunction.	1
153998	Drug therapy is also used initially to stabilize and relieve symptoms in patients with preserved ventricular function who are awaiting correction of the underlying defect that results in either volume or pressure overload.	1
153999	"Data from adults with heart failure have shown that a number of drugs provide symptom relief, and improvement in patient outcome and cardiac functions."	1
154000	"Improvement in symptoms can be achieved by diuretics, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)."	0
154001	"Prolongation of patient survival has been documented with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and aldosterone antagonists."	0
154002	"Improvement in left ventricular (LV) function and reversal of LV dilation, described as reversal of LV remodeling, is seen with the chronic use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists."	0
154003	Hospitalized patients with end-stage heart failure awaiting heart transplant may require intravenous inotropic and/or diuretics because they are refractory to oral medical therapy.	1
154004	"Based on this evidence in adults, these drugs are used in children with heart failure, if no contraindications to their use are identified."	1
154005	These drugs are discussed in detail in the following sections.	0
154006	Diuretics decrease preload by promoting natriuresis and provide relief of volume overload symptoms such as pulmonary and peripheral edema.	0
154007	Diuretics are used to treat children with stage C or D heart failure.	1
154008	Loop diuretics - Loop diuretics inhibit sodium and chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.	0
154009	Furosemide is the most commonly used loop diuretic.	0
154010	A study of 62 hospitalized children with heart failure and fluid overload demonstrated the efficacy and safety of furosemide.	1
154011	"Bumetanide and torsemide are more potent drugs, which are used less frequently and reserved for more severe or furosemide-resistant fluid overload."	0
154012	"Side effects of loop diuretics include electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hypokalemia), metabolic alkalosis, and renal insufficiency."	0
154013	Long-term therapy can lead to nephrocalcinosis and ototoxicity (usually with high intravenous dosages).	0
154014	Thiazide diuretics - Thiazide diuretics inhibit reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions from the distal convoluted tubules of kidneys.	0
154015	They generally are used as second-line agents and often in combination with a loop diuretic.	0
154016	"Commonly used thiazide diuretics are chlorothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, and metolazone."	0
154017	Aldosterone antagonists - Aldosterone antagonists decrease sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the collecting ducts of kidneys.	0
154018	Their potassium-sparing diuretic effect makes them particularly suitable for use in conjunction with loop diuretics and thiazides.	0
154019	Both spironolactone and eplerenone have been shown to reduce mortality in adults with heart failure when added to standard therapy.	1
154020	"This effect is independent of their diuretic effect and is mediated by inhibition of myocardial fibrosis, an important component of LV remodeling."	0
154021	Side effects include hyperkalemia (with both) and gynecomastia (with spironolactone).	0
154022	"Digoxin has a positive inotropic effect (mediated by Na+/K+ ATPase inhibition and increase in intracellular Ca+), a negative chronotropic effect that slows atrial conduction, and vagotonic properties that counter symptoms and signs mediated by the activation of sympathetic nervous system in heart failure."	0
154023	"Digoxin used to be the mainstay of heart failure management before the 1990s, but its role became controversial after it was found not to reduce mortality in adults with heart failure."	1
154024	"Although digoxin is no longer used in children with asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction, it continues to be used in the treatment of infants and children with stage C heart failure because of its physiologic benefit and symptom relief."	1
154025	These benefits are generally seen with a smaller dose (trough level 0.5 to 1.0 ng/mL) than was used in the past.	0
154026	Potential adverse effects (arrhythmias) are rare with this lower level.	0
154027	Heart failure leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and increased sympathetic tone.	0
154028	"ACE inhibitors and ARBs inhibit the RAAS, thereby decreasing afterload and promoting reversal of ventricular remodeling with long-term use."	0
154029	"ACE inhibitors inhibit the formation of angiotensin II: a potent vasoconstrictor that also promotes myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and aldosterone secretion."	0
154030	"Thus, ACE inhibitors benefit patients in heart failure first by reducing afterload, improving cardiac output and, on chronic use, by mediating reversal of LV remodeling."	1
154031	Clinical trials in adults have shown that ACE inhibitors improve survival in patients with symptomatic heart failure and reduce the rate at which asymptomatic patients with severe LV dysfunction develop symptomatic heart failure.	1
154032	Prospective studies with survival (or mortality) as their endpoint have not been possible in children with heart failure.	1
154033	"Nevertheless, ACE inhibitors are accepted as an important component of heart failure therapy in children."	0
154034	"The mixed results in the following pediatric studies discussed should be cautiously interpreted because of limitations in study design including small sample size (power), length of follow-up, and surrogate endpoints."	0
154035	"In one small study of 16 patients, ACE inhibitors improved cardiac function in children with systemic ventricular pump dysfunction."	1
154036	A retrospective analysis of 81 children with dilated cardiomyopathy showed that treatment with captopril was associated with better survival during the first year of treatment.	1
154037	"A randomized, controlled study of enalapril in 230 infants with single ventricle anatomy and predominantly normal systemic ventricular function did not show any difference between the enalapril and placebo groups in somatic growth, ventricular function, heart failure severity, or death after one year of therapy."	1
154038	"Children with mitral or aortic regurgitation treated with ACE inhibitors have shown inconsistent improvement in LV function, dilatation, and hypertrophy."	1
154039	"In a study of 17 children treated with anthracycline chemotherapy, enalapril was associated only with transient early benefits on LV function."	1
154040	"Despite continued enalapril therapy, deterioration in LV function and fractional shortening occurred between 6 and 10 years."	0
154041	"In a randomized, double-blinded trial in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), although groups treated with perindopril and placebo had similar LV function after three years (when the trial stopped), those treated with perindopril had late beneficial effects on LV function at 5 and 10 years."	1
154042	"Based on current evidence from adult trials and pediatric studies, most pediatric heart failure experts use ACE inhibitor therapy in children with ventricular pump dysfunction (stage B or C heart failure)."	1
154043	"Blood pressure and renal function should be closely monitored, especially in neonates."	0
154044	"In children with heart failure, there is a paucity of data in the use of ARBs, which block the angiotensin receptor."	1
154045	"Thus, ACE inhibitors are the preferred class of drugs for inhibition of the RAAS."	0
154046	ARBs are usually reserved for patients unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors due to cough or angioedema.	1
154047	Beta-blockers counteract the maladaptive effects of chronic sympathic activation of the myocardium.	0
154048	"In adults with heart failure, they improve patient survival, reverse LV remodeling, and decrease myocardial fibrosis."	1
154049	"Although mixed results have been reported in the following pediatric studies, most experts in the field use beta-blockers for children with stage C heart failure."	1
154050	"Results need to be cautiously interpreted because of limitations in study design including small sample size (power), length of follow-up, and surrogate endpoints."	0
154051	"In a retrospective multicenter study of 15 children with chronic heart failure, metoprolol was associated with a significant increase in ejection fraction from 27 to 41 percent."	1
154052	"In several small observational studies, carvedilol therapy has been associated with improved symptoms, improvement in ventricular function, and delay in time to transplant or death in children with heart failure."	1
154053	"Carvedilol therapy has also been shown to preserve LV function after exposure to anthracyclines at six months follow-up, and to improve LV function when added to ACE inhibitor therapy to patients with DMD and dilated cardiomyopathy."	1
154054	"In a multicenter trial of 161 children with heart failure and ventricular pump dysfunction, there was no difference in the composite endpoint between groups treated with carvedilol and placebo."	1
154055	"However, the study was thought to be underpowered as the clinical course of all children enrolled was better than expected."	1
154056	"There was a trend towards clinical improvement in children with a systemic LV but not in those with a systemic right ventricle (RV), suggesting that the response to carvedilol may be affected by the morphology of the child's systemic ventricle."	1
154057	A 2009 Cochrane review of beta-blockers in children with heart failure concluded there were not enough data to recommend or discourage its use.	1
154058	"Based on the current evidence in adult and pediatric patients, most pediatric heart failure experts use carvedilol in children with a systemic LV and systolic dysfunction in stage C heart failure who are stable on other heart failure medications."	1
154059	"Beta-blockers are usually added to an established regimen of diuretics, digoxin, and an ACE inhibitor."	0
154060	"Carvedilol dosing is initiated at a low dose (approximately one-eighth of the eventual target dose, usually an oral dose of 0.05 mg/kg per dose given twice a day) and increased every two weeks to minimize side effects."	0
154061	"In general, the dose is doubled after observing the response to the new higher test dose in clinic to a maximum oral dose of 0.4 mg/kg given twice a day."	0
154062	"Side effects that may preclude dose increase include dizziness, fatigue, hypotension, bradycardia, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia."	0
154063	Beta-blockers are discontinued in patients with decompensated heart failure (stage D).	1
154064	"Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, is a pulmonary vasodilator."	0
154065	"Its use has been associated with improved LV function, functional capacity, and quality of life in adults with systolic LV dysfunction and secondary pulmonary hypertension."	1
154066	"Larger, controlled studies are underway in adults with heart failure and secondary pulmonary hypertension to assess the effect of these drugs on patient survival."	0
154067	"Although sildenafil was shown to improve symptoms of heart failure in 13 children with failing Fontan physiology, it remains an investigational drug."	1
154068	Intravenous diuretics and inotropic agents are generally used in hospitalized patients with stage D heart failure.	1
154069	Inotropic agents are used during acute exacerbations of heart failure to improve cardiac output and to stabilize patients awaiting heart transplantation.	1
154070	"Their effect is mediated through higher intracellular cyclic adenylate monophosphate (cAMP) levels, either by increased production (catecholamines) or by decreased degradation (phosphodiesterase III inhibition)."	0
154071	Sympathomimetic stimulation by catecholamine agents improves myocardial contractility and may have an additional beneficial effect on peripheral vascular beds.	0
154072	"Dopamine is the preferred drug during decompensated heart failure (usually in combination with intravenous milrinone), although dobutamine has the additive effect of reducing afterload."	0
154073	"Invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure may allow dose titration for optimal end-organ perfusion, as measured by urine output, serum lactate, and mixed venous saturations."	0
154074	"Intravenous milrinone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, is the preferred drug in decompensated heart failure, as it increases contractility and reduces afterload without a significant increase in myocardial oxygen consumption."	0
154075	"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric postoperative cardiac surgery patients demonstrated that children treated with high-dose milrinone infusion (0.75 mcg/kg/min) were at a lower risk for the development of low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) compared with children treated with placebo (12 versus 26 percent)."	1
154076	"To avoid hypotension, milrinone is initially administered as an infusion starting at a dose of 0.25 mcg/kg/min (without a pre-infusion bolus) and titrated upwards slowly as needed to a maximum dose of 1.0 mcg/kg/min."	0
154077	"Although milrinone is usually used in hospitalized children with heart failure refractory to oral drug therapy awaiting heart transplantation, a small study of 14 patients reported the safe administration of intravenous at home in children awaiting heart transplants."	1
154078	Several centers (including ours) use home milrinone in selected children awaiting heart transplantation.	1
154079	"In our practice, home milrinone infusion therapy is used in children who are clinically stable without end-organ dysfunction, no history of arrhythmias, generally are on a milrinone dose <=0.5 mcg/kg/min and a stable regimen of oral diuretic therapy, and are under continuous adult supervision."	1
154080	"Nesiritide is a recombinant B-type natriuretic peptide that reduces preload and afterload by promoting diuresis, natriuresis, and arterial- and veno-dilation, thereby improving cardiac output without a direct inotropic effect on the myocardium."	0
154081	"It has been reported to be well tolerated and efficacious in children as illustrated in a prospective, open-label study in 63 children with refractory heart failure that showed nesiritide was associated with improved urine output, serum creatinine, and cardiac function."	1
154082	"However, trials in adults with acute decompensated heart failure have failed to show that nesiritide is associated with lower mortality or re-hospitalization rate, or that it improves dyspnea."	1
154083	"In addition, there is an associated increased risk of hypotension."	0
154084	"As a result, nesiritide is not recommended for general use in acute heart failure."	0
154085	Therapeutic interventions for selected patients with advanced heart failure refractory to pharmacologic therapy (stage D) may include: Positive pressure ventilation.	1
154086	Mechanical circulatory support in patients with end-stage heart failure.	1
154087	Heart transplantation.	0
154088	"Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, is effective in alleviating respiratory distress from cardiogenic pulmonary edema."	0
154089	"It promotes alveolar recruitment, improves lung compliance, and leads to decreased left ventricular preload and afterload."	0
154090	"Although there is high quality evidence of the benefit of NPPV in adult patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, there are no pediatric studies evaluating its use in heart failure."	1
154091	"In a child with decompensated heart failure, with low cardiac output syndrome unresponsive to medical therapy, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) can be life-saving."	1
154092	MCS maintains end-organ function and reduces myocardial oxygen requirements.	0
154093	It is used as a bridge to recovery (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) in patients with secondary cardiomyopathy or to heart transplantation (ECMO or ventricular assist device [VAD]).	1
154094	"In a report from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), 25 percent of pediatric heart transplant recipients received mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation."	0
154095	"The options include the following: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a total heart-lung bypass device and is used in the setting of imminent or actual cardiac arrest, such as postcardiotomy shock following cardiac surgery and acute myocarditis."	0
154096	"Cannulation can be performed percutaneously, and ECMO can provide full cardiopulmonary support for days to weeks."	0
154097	"A multicenter registry review of 3416 neonatal and 4181 pediatric cardiac ECMO cases showed a survival to discharge rate of 38 and 45 percent, respectively."	0
154098	"If myocardial recovery does not occur or is not expected to occur within two to three weeks, ECMO may be used as a bridge to a more durable ventricular assist device placement and subsequent heart transplantation."	0
154099	"Ventricular assist device (VAD), a cardiac-only support device, can offer either univentricular or biventricular support."	0
154100	"Multiple devices currently exist and differ by flow design (pulsatile, centrifugal, or axial), pump location relative to patient (implantable, paracorporeal, or extracorporeal), and delivery system (percutaneous or central)."	1
154101	They are primarily used in patients awaiting heart transplantation and have yielded favorable results.	1
154102	"A retrospective, multicenter analysis of 99 children supported by VAD as a bridge to transplantation showed a 77 percent survival to transplant."	1
154103	VAD options are limited in small children awaiting heart transplantation due to body size and anatomic considerations.	1
154104	"The choice of device depends on the etiology of heart failure, patient's cardiac anatomy, expected length of support, the availability of devices, and the expertise of the center's physicians."	0
154105	"Serious complications associated with ECMO and VAD include bleeding (eg, gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhage), thromboembolism (eg, stroke), and infection."	0
154106	Heart transplantation is recommended for end-stage heart failure refractory to medical therapy (stage D).	0
154107	"It may also be considered for less severe heart failure (stage C) associated with severe limitation of activity, significant growth failure, intractable arrhythmias, or restrictive cardiomyopathy."	0
154108	"The current survival in pediatric recipients 1, 5, and 10 years after transplantation is approximately 90, 80, and 60 percent, respectively."	0
154109	Early referral to a pediatric heart failure and transplant center should be considered to optimize medical therapy and the timing of listing for heart transplant.	0
154110	"Decision to pursue heart transplantation is based upon the expected survival with medical therapy, quality of life, alternative options for treatment, and estimation of survival post-transplantation."	0
154111	Nonpharmacologic therapy for chronic heart failure includes optimal nutrition and exercise rehabilitation.	0
154112	Growth failure is common in infants and children with heart failure.	1
154113	Nearly one-third of children with cardiomyopathy manifest growth failure during the course of their illness.	1

154380	The mechanism of action of repetitive TMS is unknown.	0
154381	One hypothesis is that stimulation of discrete cortical regions alters pathologic activity within a network of grey matter brain regions that are involved in mood regulation and connected to the targeted cortical sites.	0

Hypomania and mania have been described in randomized trials as well as case reports of patients with major depression (both unipolar and bipolar) who were treated with repetitive TMS."	1
154489	"However, the clinical significance is not known because patients with bipolar major depression can switch to mood elevated states in the absence of an antidepressant treatment."	1
154490	"A review pooled results from 10 randomized trials (520 patients with major depression) that addressed switching to mania, and found that treatment emergent mania was comparable for active repetitive TMS and sham treatment (0.8 and 0.7 percent)."	1
154491	Treatment of unipolar major depression with repetitive TMS does not appear to increase suicidal ideation or behavior.	0
154492	"In a randomized trial that compared active repetitive TMS with sham treatment in 323 patients with unipolar major depression, there were no completed suicides, and self harm occurred in one patient in the sham group."	1
154493	"In addition, increased suicidal ideation occurred in 10 patients who received sham treatment and 1 patient in the active treatment group."	1
154494	"Common side effects of repetitive TMS include: Headache and scalp pain - A review of randomized trials in patients with major depression found that the incidence of headache with active treatment and sham treatment was 28 and 16 percent, and the incidence of scalp pain with active and sham treatment was 39 and 15 percent."	1
154495	No migraine headaches have been reported.	0
154496	Headache and scalp pain may be more pronounced when higher stimulation frequencies and intensities are used;	0
154497	topical lidocaine may reduce scalp pain.	0

154503	Repetitive TMS in patients with major depression does not impair cognition.	1
154504	"Although many uncontrolled studies suggest that neuropsychological functioning may possibly improve during a course of treatment, randomized trials indicate that improvement of cognitive functioning does not differ significantly between active and sham treatment."	0
154505	"For elderly patients with major depression, repetitive TMS can be beneficial if the stimulation intensity is sufficient."	1
154506	Prefrontal atrophy in older patients can increase the distance between the coil and cortex to the point that lower intensity stimulation (which typically penetrates to a depth of two to three cm) does not affect cortical activity;	0
154507	"increasing the intensity above the motor threshold can overcome the added distance: A randomized trial compared active repetitive TMS using an intensity set at 110 percent of the motor threshold with sham treatment in 62 patients (age >= 50 years) with vascular depression (ie, late-life depression accompanied by clinical evidence of cerebrovascular disease);"	1
154508	improvement was significantly greater with active treatment.	0

154510	improvement was significantly greater with active treatment.	0
154511	"By contrast, a randomized trial in 20 patients (mean age 61 years) with treatment refractory depression found that active repetitive TMS using an intensity set at 80 percent of motor threshold provided no advantage over sham treatment."	1
154512	The clinical features and treatment of late life depression are discussed separately.	0
154513	"For pregnant and postpartum patients with major depression, observational studies suggest that repetitive TMS may possibly be safe and effective."	1
154514	It appears unlikely that the fetus is directly affected by repetitive TMS because magnetic fields rapidly attenuate with distance.	0
154515	Depression during pregnancy and postpartum depression are discussed separately.	0
154516	"Patients with major depression who do not respond to standard treatment with pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are candidates for noninvasive neuromodulation procedures, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)."	1
154517	"Repetitive TMS modulates activity in cortical regions and associated neural circuits by passing an alternating current through a metal coil placed against the scalp to generate rapidly alternating magnetic fields, which pass through the skull and induce electric currents that depolarize neurons in a focal area of the surface cortex."	0

154525	"A psychiatrist should supervise the procedure, and safety measures include ear plugs and keeping oxygen and anticonvulsant medications available for treatment of unintended seizures."	0
154526	Proconvulsant medications should generally be discontinued prior to administering repetitive TMS.	0
154527	"Investigational techniques of administering repetitive TMS include an accelerated schedule as well as high dose, theta burst, deep, and bilateral stimulation."	0
154528	"Repetitive TMS is indicated for patients with unipolar major depression who have failed at least one antidepressant medication, and contraindicated in patients with increased risks for seizures, implanted metallic hardware, cochlear implants, implanted electrical devices (eg, pacemakers, intracardiac lines, and medication pumps), and unstable general medical disorders."	1
154529	"For patients with acute major depression who have not responded to at least one antidepressant medication, meta-analyses of randomized trials have found that repetitive TMS is superior to sham treatment, but less effective than ECT."	1
154530	"However, many patients who respond subsequently suffer a recurrence."	1
154531	It is not known if maintenance treatment with repetitive TMS for unipolar major depression is beneficial.	0

154534	"Factors that increase the risk of seizures include patient factors (history of epilepsy; preexisting neurologic disorder; proconvulsant medications; recent discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, or anticonvulsants; and sleep deprivation) and stimulation parameters (higher frequency, increased intensity, and shorter intertrain interval)."	0
154535	"Common side effects include headache, scalp pain, and transient hearing loss."	0

156788	"Ischemic heart disease, also referred to as coronary heart disease, is present when a patient has one or more symptoms, signs, or complications from an inadequate supply of blood to the myocardium."	0
156789	This is most commonly due to obstruction of the epicardial coronary arteries due to atherosclerosis.	0
156790	"Patients are referred to as stable when symptoms, if present, are manageable with either medical or revascularization therapy."	0
156791	"Angina pectoris, or angina for short, occurs when myocardial oxygen demand exceeds oxygen supply;"	0
156792	the clinical manifestation is often chest discomfort.	0
156793	"Stable angina pectoris, or stable angina, refers to chest discomfort that occurs predictably and reproducibly at a certain level of exertion and is relieved with rest or nitroglycerin."	0
156794	Most patients with ischemic heart disease will experience angina as part of the clinical manifestations of the disease.	1
156795	"The care of patients with ischemic heart disease includes ascertainment of the diagnosis and its severity, control of symptoms, and therapies to improve survival."	1
156796	This topic will provide an overview of these issues and will direct the reader to more detailed discussions when appropriate.	0
156797	"In particular, this topic will focus on patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD)."	1
156798	The care of patients with unstable ischemic heart disease is discussed elsewhere.	1
156799	Many patients can be given the diagnosis of SIHD based on a classic history of angina pectoris in the presence of one or more risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.	0
156800	When first evaluated for possible SIHD patients should receive a thorough physical examination in addition to a complete history.	0
156801	An electrocardiogram should be performed in all patients.	0
156802	"However, most patients will require diagnostic testing either to secure the diagnosis or to evaluate the extent of disease."	0
156803	"We agree with the 2012 ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with stable ischemic heart disease, which recommends that most patients with suspected SIHD undergo stress testing to secure the diagnosis and to gain prognostic information."	1
156804	"The choice of initial stress test, such as with exercise electrocardiogram (ECG), exercise with imaging, or pharmacologic stress testing with imaging, may be influenced the patient's resting ECG, physical ability to perform exercise, local expertise, and available technologies."	0
156805	"Once this information has been obtained, the therapeutic approach is determined by the results of the test(s) and individual patient characteristics."	0
156806	Low- and intermediate-risk patients whose symptoms are controlled on medical therapy can be managed without intervention while high-risk patients or those with angina refractory to medical therapy undergo coronary angiography and revascularization with either PCI or CABG.	1
156807	"In patients with SIHD, there are two primary indications for coronary angiography followed by revascularization of appropriate lesions: Angina that significantly interferes with a patient's lifestyle despite maximal tolerable medical therapy."	1
156808	"Patients with high-risk criteria and selected patients with intermediate-risk criteria on noninvasive testing, regardless of anginal severity."	1
156809	"For these indications, it is assumed that patients are candidates for revascularization, if indicated."	0
156810	We also believe coronary angiography is reasonable in patients with atypical symptoms and equivocal findings on stress testing in whom a diagnosis needs to be established.	1
156811	"Although coronary angiography is the traditional gold standard for the diagnosis of coronary atherosclerosis, it is not a reliable indicator of the functional significance of any single coronary stenosis."	0
156812	"However, the extent and severity of coronary heart disease identified on coronary angiography are powerful clinical predictors of prognosis and the findings are often used to guide further therapy in patients with angina pectoris."	1
156813	Revascularization is performed in appropriate patients in whom angiography reveals anatomy for which revascularization has a proven benefit or in whom medical therapy has failed.	1
156814	The choice between PCI and CABG is based upon anatomy and other factors such as left ventricular function and the presence or absence of diabetes.	0
156815	"With the availability of drug-eluting stents, PCI is increasingly performed for most lesions."	0
156816	These issues are discussed in detail separately.	0
156817	Most patients with SIHD do not need measurement of left ventricular systolic function.	1
156818	"However, it may be useful in selected patients to determine optimal medical therapy, the role of interventional or surgical therapy, or in making recommendations about activity level, rehabilitation, and work status."	0
156819	"We suggest that the following patients with SIHD merit an assessment of left ventricular systolic function (generally with the use of Doppler echocardiography): Prior myocardial infarction, diagnosed either by history or pathologic Q waves on an electrocardiogram."	1
156820	Symptoms or signs of heart failure.	0
156821	Undiagnosed heart murmur.	0
156822	Complex ventricular arrhythmias.	0
156823	The methodology for the measurement of LV systolic function is discussed separately.	0
156824	"There are three classes of antiischemic drugs commonly used in the management of angina pectoris: beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitrates."	0
156825	"Often, a combination of these agents is used for control of symptoms."	0
156826	"We agree with the 2012 ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with stable ischemic heart disease, which recommends beta blockers as first line therapy to reduce anginal episodes and improve exercise tolerance."	1
156827	The use of these agents in patients with SIHD is discussed in detail elsewhere.	1
156828	Beta blockers relieve anginal symptoms by reducing both heart rate and contractility.	0
156829	"Since beta blockers reduce the heart rate-blood pressure product during exercise, the onset of angina or the ischemic threshold during exercise is delayed or avoided."	0
156830	All types of beta blockers appear to be equally effective in exertional angina.	0
156831	"In addition, beta blockers are the only antianginal drugs proven to prevent reinfarction and to improve survival in patients who have sustained an MI."	1
156832	Beta blockers should not be used in patients with vasospastic or variant (Prinzmetal) angina.	1
156833	"In such patients, they are ineffective and may increase the tendency to induce coronary vasospasm from unopposed alpha-receptor activity."	0
156834	"In general, calcium channel blockers are used in combination with beta blockers when initial treatment with beta blockers is not successful or as a substitute for a beta blocker when beta blockers are contraindicated or cause side effects."	0
156835	Calcium channel blockers improve anginal symptomatology by causing coronary and peripheral vasodilatation and reducing contractility.	0
156836	The degree to which these changes occur varies with the type of calcium channel blocker given.	0
156837	Long-acting diltiazem or verapamil or a second generation dihydropyridine (amlodipine or felodipine) are preferred.	0
156838	"Short-acting dihydropyridines, especially nifedipine, should be avoided unless used in conjunction with a beta blocker in the management of SIHD because of evidence of an increase in mortality after an MI and an increase in acute MI in hypertensive patients."	0
156839	"Although beta blockers and calcium channel blockers have similar efficacy in the management of stable angina, we prefer starting with the former."	0
156840	This is based principally on the observation of survival benefit with beta blockers in patients with prior myocardial infarction or impaired left ventricular systolic function.	1
156841	Such a benefit has not been observed.	0
156842	Addition of a second drug (usually either a calcium channel blocker or a nitrate) is indicated if angina persists with monotherapy.	0
156843	The efficacy of combination therapy was illustrated in a study that randomly assigned 397 patients to four weeks of monotherapy with felodipine or metoprolol or a combination of felodipine and metoprolol.	1
156844	Combination therapy was more effective for increasing exercise duration and better tolerated than monotherapy.	0
156845	"Although a third class of antianginal drug can be added in patients who have limiting angina on two agents, many physicians would consider coronary angiography in such patients and revascularization if indicated."	1
156846	"Nitrates, usually in the form of a sublingual preparation, are the first-line therapy for the treatment of acute anginal symptoms."	0
156847	Patients should be instructed to use them at the onset of angina.	0
156848	They may also be recommended for the prophylaxis of anginal episodes.	0
156849	"Long-acting nitrates are added to beta blockers (with or without calcium channel blockers), to control stable angina."	0
156850	"In patients with exertional stable angina, chronic nitrate therapy using oral or dermal preparations improves exercise tolerance, time to onset of angina, and ST-segment depression during exercise testing."	1
156851	"In combination with beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, nitrates produce greater antianginal and antiischemic effects compared to those drugs without nitrates."	0
156852	"However, the long-term utility of nitrates is limited by the induction of nitrate tolerance."	0
156853	There is no difference in efficacy among the various oral or dermal nitrate preparations.	0
156854	"The use of these as well as their side effects, including nitrate tolerance, is discussed elsewhere."	0
156855	A number of newer medical and invasive therapies have been evaluated for use in patients with stable angina.	1
156856	"Of these, ranolazine, a late sodium channel blocker, is the most widely used."	0
156857	Ranolazine is used either in combination with a beta blocker or as a substitute in patients who cannot receive one.	1
156858	"Non-pharmacologic therapies that may benefit patients with angina refractory to the above medical therapies include enhanced external counterpulsation, spinal cord stimulation, and transmyocardial revascularization."	1
156859	These are discussed elsewhere.	0
156860	Ivabridine (not available in the United States) is a novel agent that acts specifically on the sinus node ionic channels to slow the heart rate.	0
156861	"There is no effect on blood pressure, conduction, or cardiac contractility."	0
156862	"This results in isolated slowing of the pulse and consequent improvement in angina threshold without the side effect of depression, cardiac function, or potentially increasing atrio-ventricular block."	0
156863	"Treatment of any underlying medical conditions that might aggravate myocardial ischemia, such as hypertension, fever, tachyarrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation), thyrotoxicosis, anemia or polycythemia, hypoxemia, or valvular heart disease should be undertaken."	0
156864	"Asymptomatic low grade arrhythmias are not treated routinely, but may require therapy under circumstances, such as left ventricular dysfunction."	0
156865	"There should also be modification of activities that exacerbate angina, such as exercise in cold weather or after a meal."	0
156866	The optimal management of patients with stable angina requires more than antianginal therapy.	1
156867	Therapies aimed at preventing cardiovascular events are also central- to long-term care.	0
156868	"We agree with the 2012 ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with stable ischemic heart disease, which recommends that all patients with SIHD should receive education and counseling about issues such as medication compliance, control of risk factors, and regular exercise."	1
156869	"In the absence of a contraindication, all patients should be treated with aspirin."	0
156870	We believe that doses of aspirin from 75 to 325 mg daily are associated with the best risk/benefit ratio.	0
156871	Some experts prefer to stay within the 75 to 162 mg per day range.	0
156872	"Patients who have a gastrointestinal bleed on low dose aspirin should, after the episode is controlled, be treated with aspirin (81 mg/day) plus a proton pump inhibitor."	1
156873	Clopidogrel is an alternative in patients who are allergic to aspirin.	1
156874	Risk factor reduction should be a central component of the management of patients with stable angina.	1
156875	"This includes treatment of hypertension, cessation of smoking, initiation of statin therapy, weight reduction, and glycemic control in diabetics."	0
156876	"In addition to contributing to chronic progression of atherosclerosis, smoking and hypertension can precipitate acute coronary ischemia by increasing oxygen demands and reducing oxygen supply."	0
156877	The specific goals are described elsewhere.	0
156878	"Stress reduction should also be encouraged and treatment of underlying depression and anxiety should be considered, if appropriate."	0
156879	"The impact of these interventions in patients with chronic CHD and stable angina is unknown, although their role in patients with a prior MI is better established."	1
156880	There are conflicting data regarding whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce exercise-induced ischemia.	0
156881	We believe the evidence is not convincing and do not recommend ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin-receptor blockers) to improve angina.	0
156882	"However, these agents have been shown to be of benefit in subsets of patients with SIHD, such as those with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40 percent, or chronic kidney disease."	1
156883	Their use in these patients is discussed elsewhere.	0
156884	"All patients with SIHD should receive an annual influenza vaccine, unless contraindicated."	1
156885	Gradual institution of a regular aerobic exercise program should be encouraged.	0
156886	"Exercise can result in a lower oxygen requirement for a given workload, thereby improving exercise tolerance and a sense of well-being, and reducing symptoms."	0
156887	"An exercise program is also beneficial in the management of risk factors for CHD such as lipids, blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes mellitus."	0
156888	Recommendations for referral to cardiac rehabilitation programs and routine physical activity for patients with stable angina pectoris are discussed separately.	1
156889	Individuals over the age of 65 years represent a growing proportion of the population in developed countries;	1
156890	"as the population ages, the frequency of ISHD increases."	0
156891	"In addition, elderly patients who have ISHD have more severe disease than younger subjects."	1
156892	The approach to the management of angina in older adults should not differ substantially from that advocated for younger patients.	0
156893	"However, diagnostic testing and both medical and interventional therapy have been underutilized in this population."	0
156894	"This occurs for several reasons: Elderly patients with CHD often present with atypical symptoms, including exertional dyspnea."	1
156895	Silent myocardial ischemia is also common.	0
156896	"The efficacy of therapies for CHD in older adults is often unrecognized or underestimated, in part because older adults are usually underrepresented in randomized controlled studies."	0
156897	The presence of comorbid conditions and difficulties managing medications in older adults also complicate care.	0
156898	All of the drugs used in younger patients for the control of anginal symptoms are appropriate for older adults.	1
156899	"However, older adults may experience more side effects, particularly hypotension from nitrates and calcium channel blockers and central nervous system effects from beta blockers."	0
156900	Elderly patients may need to be started on lower doses initially and should be monitored carefully for side effects.	0
156901	"While older adults have been underrepresented in clinical trials, there are sufficient data that medical and revascularization therapies are effective in older adults."	0
156902	The decision whether to continue with optimal medical therapy or perform revascularization requires the elderly patient's understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and a respect by the health care delivery team of that patient's subsequent preferences.	0
156903	Patients with chronic stable angina require follow-up on a regular basis.	1
156904	We suggest follow-up every six to twelve months.	0
156905	"At each visit, a detailed history should be obtained and physical examination performed."	0
156906	"In particular, it is important to establish: A change in physical activity."	0
156907	"Any change in the frequency, severity, or pattern of angina."	0
156908	Tolerance of and compliance with the medical program.	0
156909	Modification of risk factors.	0
156910	The development of new or worsened comorbid illnesses.	0
156911	"In addition to laboratory studies such as blood glucose or a lipid profile, an ECG should be obtained if medications are altered or if the history or physical examination have changed."	0
156912	"UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."""	0
156913	"The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition."	0
156914	"These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials."	1
156915	"Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed."	0
156916	These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.	1

156921	"The principal goals in the care of patients with stable ischemic heart disease, also referred to as coronary heart disease, are to secure the diagnosis, relieve symptoms, and to prevent future cardiac events such as acute coronary syndromes, revascularization, or death."	1
156922	The following is a summary of the strategy to achieve these goals: Patients in whom the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease is suspected but not previously secured should undergo a complete history and physical examination and receive a 12 lead electrocardiogram.	1
156923	Most patients should undergo some form of stress testing to either secure the diagnosis or evaluate its severity.	0
156924	Beta blockers are preferred for initial treatment of symptoms.	0
156925	Calcium channel blockers and nitrates are used routinely to relieve symptoms when initial treatment with beta blockers is not successful or if beta blockers are contraindicated or cause side effects.	0
156926	"Ranolazine has been used successfully to improve anginal symptoms in patients who have not been successfully treated with nitrates, beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers."	1
156927	Regular exercise may reduce anginal symptoms.	0
156928	Therapies known to reduce the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events such as death and myocardial infarction should be started.	0
156929	"These include aspirin, statin, smoking cessation, control of blood pressure and excess weight, and optimal management of diabetes."	0
156930	Regular exercise and stress reduction are also recommended.	0
156931	"The optimal management of these patients also requires periodic evaluation of the patient's clinical status, using the history, physical examination, and on occasion the electrocardiogram."	0
157526	"Patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD) have a high risk of subsequent cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and death from cardiovascular disease (CVD)."	1
157527	"Therapeutic lifestyle changes which include identification and treatment of established risk factors, especially hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, obesity/poor diet, physical inactivity and diabetes, are primary and major strategies to diminish premature morbidity and mortality from CVD and are recommended in many societal guidelines."	0
157528	"Therapeutic lifestyle changes in the form of increased physical activity, dietary modification/weight loss, and smoking cessation are of proven benefit and may improve outcomes in as quickly as six months."	0
157529	"The adjunctive drug therapies of proven benefit include aspirin, statins, and, in patients with MI or heart failure, beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)."	1
157530	The efficacy of risk factor reduction and other adjunctive therapies for the secondary prevention of CVD will be reviewed here.	0
157531	The efficacy of cardiac rehabilitation programs in improving outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease is discussed elsewhere.)	1
157532	The secondary prevention of ischemic stroke is also discussed separately.	0
157533	Some patients without known CHD have a risk of subsequent cardiovascular events that is equivalent to that of patients with established coronary disease.	1
157534	All patients with a CHD risk equivalent should be managed as aggressively as those with prior CHD.	1
157535	"The Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III, or ATP III) published in 2002 classified high-risk patients with a prior CVD event or a CHD risk equivalent into three groups:"	1
157536	"Patients with CHD have increased risks of MI as well as noncoronary atherosclerotic vascular disease, such as stroke."	1
157537	The magnitude of these increased risks was quantified in a community-based study of 2160 patients with an acute MI who were followed for a median of 5.6 years.	1
157538	"In the first 30 days, the rate of first stroke was increased 44-fold compared to the general population (2.3 per 100 person-months)."	0
157539	"After this early post-MI period, the stroke risk fell by more than 90 percent but remained two to three times higher than expected for the first three years."	0
157540	The occurrence of a stroke after MI was associated with an almost threefold increase in mortality.	0
157541	"As defined by ATP III, noncoronary atherosclerotic arterial disease includes patients with carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease, or abdominal aortic aneurysm, all of whom have a 10-year risk of CHD >20 percent."	1
157542	Patients without prior CHD but with multiple risk factors that confer a 10-year risk of CHD >20 percent are considered to have a CHD risk equivalent.	1
157543	The 10-year risk of CHD is assessed using the ATP III modification of the Framingham risk score  . These patients include those with the metabolic syndrome.	0
157544	"In a random sample of the United States population, using the ATP III definition, 40 percent of patients age 40 and over have metabolic syndrome and their average risk of a first CHD event over 10 years is 16 to 18 percent."	1
157545	"Thus, many patients with metabolic syndrome need to be managed as aggressively as patients with prior CHD."	1
157546	The early evidence supporting diabetes as a CHD equivalent derived from a large prospective cohort study in which patients with type 2 diabetes without a prior MI were at the same risk for CHD events as nondiabetic patients who had had a prior MI (mean age 56 to 58 years in both groups).	1
157547	"At seven years, the incidence of fatal or nonfatal MI was 20 and 19 percent for these two groups, respectively."	0
157548	"Other observational study data, however, have found that patients with diabetes, but without CHD, have a lower rate of CHD events than those without diabetes but with prior CHD."	1
157549	"These discrepancies may, however, be more apparent than real and may be confounded by age and duration of diabetes, both independent risk factors for CHD."	0
157550	Subgroup analyses of diabetics randomized in the Heart Protection Study contributed to the formulation of the hypothesis of lipid lowering with 40 mg of simvastatin in diabetic patients without prior CHD to reduce risks of subsequent CVD events.	1
157551	Randomized evidence from the CARDS trial supports the recommendation to treat patients with diabetes with a statin.	1
157552	"CARDS was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial among diabetics testing 10 mg atorvastatin."	0
157553	"After three years of a planned five-year duration, the Steering Committee accepted the unanimous recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to terminate the trial early due to the emergence of a statistically extreme 37 percent reduction in the primary endpoint."	0
157554	In addition to these groups of high-risk patients there are other categories considered by other agencies in their guidelines.	0
157555	"The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines on ST elevation myocardial infarction recommended that chronic kidney disease be considered a CHD risk equivalent, based upon evidence that renal dysfunction (even of mild degree) is associated with an increase in CHD risk."	0
157556	"While these guidelines did not give a precise definition of significant renal dysfunction, it may be defined by a serum creatinine concentration that exceeds 1.5 mg/dL [133 micromol/L] or an estimated glomerular filtration rate that is less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2."	0
157557	"Depression is not a major independent risk factor in the development of CHD, but occurs frequently in patients with established CVD and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality."	1
157558	The 2008 American Heart Association (AHA) scientific advisory on Depression and Coronary Heart Disease recommends screening for depressive symptoms in such patients and treatment.	0
157559	The AHA advisory recommends the Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) for screening.	0
157560	"Using this tool, the provider asks the patient the following two part question: Over the past two weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems: Little interest or pleasure in doing things."	0
157561	"Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless."	0
157562	"A ""yes"" answer to either part should prompt the practitioner to arrange for a more comprehensive evaluation by a qualified professional."	0
157563	Risk reduction therapy is recommended for all patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the 2011 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) guideline on secondary prevention.	1
157564	"In patients with CHD, these measures are referred to as ""secondary prevention,"" or prevention of complications due to established disease."	1
157565	"In addition, however, equally intensive risk factor modification is recommended in patients with CHD risk equivalent."	1
157566	"Based upon numerous randomized trials of statins published after ATP III, including those with active statin comparators, the Coordinating Committee of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute proposed modifications to the ATP III guidelines in July 2004, which were endorsed by the ACC and AHA."	0
157567	"They defined a group of ""very high risk"" patients and recommended more aggressive risk-factor modification for such patients, specifically with respect to lipid modification."	1
157568	"Risk-factor modification for secondary prevention will be reviewed here, with the evidence supporting each of the recommended modalities."	0
157569	More detailed discussions of each risk factor are presented elsewhere on the appropriate topic reviews as is the efficacy of primary prevention of CVD and stroke.	0
157570	Patient education regarding his/her risk factors and their management is central to secondary prevention.	0
157571	We agree with the following points made in 2012 ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD).	1
157572	"Patients with SIHD should have an individualized education plan to optimized care and promote wellness that includes education on medication adherence, an explanation of medication management and cardiovascular risk reduction strategies in a manner that respects the patient's level of understanding, a comprehensive review of all therapeutic options, a description of appropriate levels of exercise, introduction to self-monitoring skills, and information on how to recognize worsening cardiovascular symptoms and take appropriate action."	1
157573	Prospective observational cohort studies have shown a curvilinear relationship between the serum cholesterol concentration and subsequent risk of CHD.	0
157574	"More recently, randomized trials and their meta-analyses show similar findings."	0
157575	Secondary prevention patients with established CHD have far higher absolute risks of recurrent events than the majority of primary prevention subjects.	1
157576	"During the past two decades, many large randomized trials of secondary prevention in patients with prior CVD events, have demonstrated the benefit of lipid lowering, with statin therapy on subsequent risks of MI, stroke, and CVD events."	1
157577	Statin therapy lowers the risk of death by 15 to 20 percent and lowers the risk of non-fatal cardiovascular events by an even greater degree.	0
157578	"In subgroup analyses, the data from these trials have led to the formulation of the hypothesis that, as regards statin therapy, lower is better with regard to serum cholesterol, particularly low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol)."	0
157579	"This hypothesis was tested in a number of active comparator trials which did not compare a higher LDL-cholesterol target to a lower one, but rather one dose of a statin to either another dose of the same statin (or another statin)."	0
157580	"Thus, the benefit seen in these trials could be due to a greater degree of LDL-cholesterol lowering or to pleiotropic effects of a higher statin dose."	0
157581	The secondary prevention trials of lipid modification with statins also demonstrated statistically significant and clinically important reductions in stroke.	0
157582	Meta-analyses contributed to the formulation of the hypothesis that statin therapy compared to placebo results in a significant 30 percent reduction in stroke over a wide range of lipid values.	0
157583	The individual randomized trials indicated similar benefits of statins primarily due to significant reductions in ischemic stroke.	0
157584	"Despite important improvement in outcomes with statin therapy, many optimally treated patients experience one or more adverse outcomes."	0
157585	"In a meta-analysis of nearly 29,000 patients with CVD in 14 randomized trials comparing statin to no statin, 21.2 percent of treated patients experienced a major cardiovascular event during five years of follow-up."	1
157586	The determinants of the residual risk of an event were evaluated in a study of 9251 CHD patients with LDL-C <130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) and treated with atorvastatin in the TNT study.	1
157587	"Multivariable determinants identified were older age, increased body-mass index, male gender, hypertension, diabetes, baseline apolipoprotein B, and blood urea nitrogen."	0
157588	These findings highlight the importance of aggressively treating all modifiable risk factors in patients with established cardiovascular disease.	1
157589	"We suggest that all patients with atherosclerotic CVD be treated with at least a moderate dose of a statin, irrespective of the baseline LDL-cholesterol, including those whose baseline LDL-cholesterol is below the goals set below."	1
157590	The ATP III guidelines published in 2001 recommended that the goal LDL-cholesterol should be less than 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) in all high-risk patients including secondary prevention and in those with a coronary equivalent including diabetes.	1
157591	This goal for high-risk patients was also recommended by the 2011 AHA/ACCF guideline for secondary prevention.	0
157592	"This guideline also recommended a LDL-cholesterol goal of less than 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) for patients a very high risk, such as those with established CVD plus multiple major risk factors, severe and poorly controlled risk factors, multiple risk factors of the metabolic syndrome, and patients with acute coronary syndromes."	1
157593	"Diabetes has been considered a coronary risk equivalent, but the patient specific risk should be calculated, prior to recommending statin therapy."	0
157594	"Based upon the totality of evidence to date, especially the statistically significant and clinically important overall results of PROVE-IT-TIMI 22 and TNT, we suggest a target LDL-C concentration <=70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) in patients with established CHD;"	1
157595	"with CHD equivalents such as noncoronary atherosclerotic vascular disease, or chronic kidney disease;"	0
157596	and in patients with multiple risk factors that confer a 10-year risk of CHD >20 percent.	1
157597	This recommendation is supported by results of individual trials as well as a comprehensive world-wide patient level meta-analysis of all active comparator trials of statins designed a priori to test the hypothesis.	0
157598	"Some have recommended a less aggressive approach based upon their interpretation of small increases in side effects at higher dose statin therapy, cost of the these medications, and the absence of a benefit on total mortality in many trials, despite the fact that none was designed a priori to test this hypothesis."	0
157599	"Both therapeutic lifestyle changes, including dietary modification and increased levels of physical activity as well as adjunctive drug therapy with statins should be used to achieve the goals  . Statins are first-line drugs for virtually all patients who present with dyslipidemia, since they have proven benefits on MI, stroke and CVD death and produce marked decreases in LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, and modest increases in HDL-cholesterol."	1
157600	"In addition, the totality of evidence from randomized trials, including morbidity and mortality benefits, is far larger and far more persuasive for statins than any other modalities."	0
157601	"Finally, statins, especially those of higher potency, appear to have pleiotropic effects beyond LDL-cholesterol lowering, which produce clinical benefits within weeks to months."	0
157602	"In patients with a serum triglyceride concentration >=200 mg/dL (2.26 mmol/L), ATP III defined the appropriate target of therapy to be non-HDL-cholesterol rather than LDL-cholesterol."	1
157603	Non-HDL-cholesterol is defined as the difference between the total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol.	0
157604	The goal for non-HDL-cholesterol in this setting is a concentration that is 30 mg/dL (0.78 mmol/L) higher than that for LDL cholesterol.	0
157605	"Among patients with an acute MI or unstable angina who are not already being treated, statin therapy should be initiated prior to discharge."	1
157606	"This recommendation is based, in part, upon the data from PROVE IT-TIMI 22 that revealed a significant benefit that was apparent within one month."	0
157607	"Based upon the results of PROVE IT-TIMI 22, we recommend therapy with atorvastatin 80 mg/day in all patients with an ACS."	1
157608	"Initial intensive therapy, rather than gradual dose titration upward, is recommended, in part, because most patients remain at their initial dose and also because of the suggestion in PROVE IT-TIMI 22 of benefit within 30 days, an interval before the first serum cholesterol measurement on therapy would usually be obtained."	0
157609	"Evaluation of the response of lipids to statin therapy after an acute coronary syndrome should be deferred for two months, since acute phase responses and perhaps other factors can transiently lower LDL-cholesterol by 40 to 50 percent and thus, in some patients, cause spuriously normal-appearing levels following an acute coronary syndrome )."	0
157610	"The magnitude of this effect, at least soon after hospitalization, appears to be less with current therapies that limit the degree of myocardial injury, such as percutaneous coronary intervention or fibrinolytic therapy."	0
157611	These issues are discussed elsewhere.	0
157612	The long-term goal for serum LDL-cholesterol is less than 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L).	0
157613	"Benefit that intensive statin therapy reduces not only a first CV event, but also recurrent events as compared with standard statin therapy has been documented in three trials."	0
157614	"Other possible options include the addition of other agents such as fibrates, niacin, fish oil, or ezetimibe, although the totality of evidence is far smaller and less persuasive."	0
157615	"In addition, although direct randomized evidence is accumulating at present, none of these agents has been shown to improve clinical cardiovascular disease outcomes beyond that achieved with statin therapy."	0
157616	It has been suggested evaluating the C-reactive protein (CRP) response after optimal statin therapy and implementing further treatment to reduce elevated serum CRP.	0
157617	"This approach is in part based upon subgroup analyses from PROVE IT-TIMI 22 that patients with serum CRP values >=2 mg/L had higher risks of cardiovascular events than those with lower levels (3.9 versus 2.8 per 100 patient-years), even in patients with posttreatment serum LDL-cholesterol values below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L; 3.1 versus 2.4 per 100 patient-years)."	1
157618	"These findings indicate no effect modification by LDL-cholesterol in the ability of CRP to predict cardiovascular events, but do not necessarily imply that the CRP benefit is independent of LDL-cholesterol."	0
157619	"In fact, in a meta-analysis of observational epidemiological studies, LDL was a far more important predictor of subsequent CVD events than CRP."	0
157620	Similar findings were noted in phase Z of the A-to-Z trial in which achieved levels of serum CRP at 30 days and four months after ACS were associated with long-term survival irrespective of treatment assignment.	0
157621	Lower CRP levels were more likely to be attained in patients treated with higher doses of a statin.	1
157622	"At present, there is no consensus on a threshold level to define ""elevated"" serum CRP, although a statement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association published in 2003 proposed definitions of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk levels."	0
157623	Some studies have questioned the additional contribution of measuring CRP in the clinical setting.	0
157624	This issue is discussed elsewhere.	0
157625	"Since there is no evidence from randomized trials about the efficacy of further drug therapy targeted to CRP goals, most experts would not modify management further if serum CRP remains elevated after these steps."	0
157626	"A clinical decision to implement additional drug treatment, which could include: In patients not already receiving maximal statin therapy (eg, 80 mg of atorvastatin or 40 mg of rosuvastatin), an increase in statin dose or a change to a more potent statin."	1
157627	"The addition of other classes of lipid lowering drugs including fibrates, niacin, fish oil or ezetimibe."	0
157628	"However, as mentioned above, none of these drugs has been shown to improve clinical outcomes beyond that achieved with statin therapy."	0
157629	"In addition, a meta-analysis of the over 90,000 patients randomized in statin trials shows statistically significant and clinically important benefits on subsequent MI, stroke, cardiovascular death, and total mortality."	1
157630	"Interestingly, in five years of treatment and follow-up, there were 15 incident cases of rhabdomyolysis, nine in the statin group and six in the control group."	0
157631	This totality of randomized evidence is more than tenfold greater than for any other adjunctive therapy.	0
157632	"Further, the benefits of niacin and fish oil were achieved in the absence of statins."	0
157633	The preceding discussion has emphasized the importance of control of serum LDL-cholesterol as well as possible benefits of statin therapy that are unrelated to lipid lowering.	0
157634	"In addition, low HDL-cholesterol and high triglycerides each appear to contribute independently to cardiovascular risk and the combination is associated with a greater likelihood of other features of the metabolic syndrome."	0
157635	The benefit of raising serum low HDL-cholesterol or lowering triglycerides in patients with CHD was demonstrated with gemfibrozil in the VA-HIT trial and with the combination of simvastatin and niacin in a smaller trial of similar patients.	1
157636	"In the VA-HIT trial, 2531 patients with CHD with a low HDL-cholesterol (<=40 mg/dL [1.0 mmol/L]), a low LDL-cholesterol (<=140 mg/dL or 3.6 mmol/L), and triglyceride levels <=300 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) were randomly assigned to gemfibrozil or placebo."	1
157637	"At five years, the combined primary endpoint of cardiac death and nonfatal MI occurred significantly less often in the gemfibrozil group (17.3 versus 21.7 percent for placebo)."	0
157638	The beneficial effect did not become apparent until two years after randomization.	0
157639	"Patients taking gemfibrozil also had a lower rate of stroke (4.6 versus 6 percent for placebo), transient ischemic attacks (1.7 versus 4.2 percent), and carotid endarterectomy (1.3 versus 3.5 percent)."	1
157640	The reduction in stroke risk was evident after 6 to 12 months of therapy.	0
157641	"However, 38 percent of the cases of rhabdomyolysis in the United States Food and Drug Administration data base are attributable to gemfibrozil either alone or in combination with statins."	0
157642	Fenofibrate has less potential for such toxicity and is the preferred fibrate in patients treated with a statin.	1
157643	"It is recommended that, for secondary prevention, patients who have a persistently low HDL-cholesterol concentration (<40 mg/dL [1.03 mmol/L]) after the goal LDL-cholesterol concentration has been achieved with a statin should be started on nonpharmacologic therapy (eg, exercise, smoking cessation, weight loss in obese subjects);"	1
157644	nicotinic acid or a fibrate can be added if this is ineffective.	0
157645	"Large trial results with the use of niacin, however, have been disappointing."	0
157646	Many patients with low HDL-cholesterol concentrations also have elevated triglycerides.	1
157647	"The goal for triglycerides is less than 150 mg/dL which may be achieved with statins alone or the addition of adjunctive therapies, such as fish oil or fibrates."	0
157648	"The Stroke Council of the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association recommended in 2004 that statins should be started during hospitalization for all patients with transient ischemic attack or first stroke of atherosclerotic origin who are not already being treated, regardless of serum total cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol levels."	1
157649	The seventh Joint National Committee (JNC 7) report proposed the following definitions based upon the average of two or more properly measured readings at each of two or more visits after an initial screen: Normal blood pressure - systolic <120 mmHg and diastolic <80 mmHg.	0
157650	Prehypertension - systolic 120-139 mmHg or diastolic 80-89 mmHg.	0
157651	Hypertension - systolic >=140 mmHg or diastolic >=90 mmHg.	0
157652	Patients with prehypertension have higher rates of progression to overt hypertension as well as increases in cardiovascular mortality.	1
157653	The most reliable evidence that pharmacologic treatment of mild to moderate hypertension decreases risks of cardiovascular complications comes from large-scale randomized trials designed a priori to test the hypothesis and their meta-analyses.	0
157654	"In a comprehensive patient level meta-analysis of trials of patients with mild to moderate hypertension, lowering the blood pressure with antihypertensive therapy by 4-5 mmHg reduces the rate of stroke by about 40 percent and CHD by about 16 percent."	1
157655	"Not surprisingly, the presence of other risk factors influences treatment decisions."	0
157656	Major societal guidelines recommend therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC)s for all apparently healthy individuals with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg or greater.	1
157657	"Appropriate measures include moderate dietary sodium restriction, weight reduction in the obese, avoidance of excess alcohol intake, and regular physical activity )."	0
157658	"Institution of these TLCs involves little or no risk and all are likely to be beneficial, even in apparently healthy normotensive subjects."	0
157659	The goal blood pressure in patients with established CVD is discussed in detail separately.	1
157660	General issues related to the choice of antihypertensive drugs are discussed in detail separately.	0
157661	"In addition, certain underlying diseases warrant the use of specific antihypertensive drugs, independent of their effect on blood pressure."	0
157662	"Among patients with CVD: Most patients who have had a MI, especially those with diabetes or metabolic syndrome, should be treated with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), as well as beta blocker, independent of BP control."	1
157663	Patients with stable angina may require therapy may require therapy with a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker for symptom control.	1
157664	Therapeutic lifestyle changes have statistically significant and clinically important beneficial effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and should be an integral component of any secondary prevention program.	0
157665	"The benefits from modification of multiple risk factors are additive, at the very least."	0
157666	We agree with the 2011 AHA/ACCF guideline on secondary prevention which recommends referral to a comprehensive outpatient cardiovascular rehabilitation program for all eligible patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome or revascularization procedure.	1
157667	"Other patients, such as those with these diagnoses in the past year, those with chronic angina, or those with peripheral artery disease, may be candidates for referral."	1
157668	Smoking cessation produces benefits on CVD beginning within a matter of months and reaching the nonsmoker in three to five years.	0
157669	These benefits have been shown in secondary and primary prevention.	0
157670	"In a meta-analysis of 12,603 smokers who had prior MI, CABG, angioplasty, or known CHD, the relative risk of mortality for quitters compared with those who continued to smoke was 0.64 (95% CI 0.58-0.71)."	0
157671	"In a cohort study of 2619 patients who survived to hospital discharge after a first MI, among those who quit smoking (patients who quit and restarted were considered active smokers), the risk ratio for recurrent events progressively and significantly decreased with longer duration of cessation (RR 1.62 at 0 to <6 months, 1.60 from 6 to <18 months, 1.48 for 18 to <36 months, and 1.02 for >=36 months)."	1
157672	The various major effective modalities to attain and sustain smoking cessation are discussed separately.	0
157673	"We agree with the 2011 AHA/ACCF guideline on secondary prevention, which recommends complete smoking cessation as well as avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke in all patients."	0
157674	"Obesity, particularly central or abdominal obesity, is associated with increased risks for CVD."	0
157675	"While obesity contributes to hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance leading to diabetes among those with metabolic syndrome, the increased risks of CVD are also present for obese patients without metabolic syndrome."	1
157676	"These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere, but will be briefly reviewed here."	0
157677	Obesity is a risk factor for CHD in both men and women.	0
157678	"The increase in risk is seen with increasing weight within the ""normal"" range, but is most pronounced with obesity."	0
157679	"Using a body mass index (BMI) less than 21 kg/m2 as a reference in the Nurses' Health Study, the adjusted relative risk for CHD was 1.19 at a BMI of 21 to 22.9 kg/m2, 1.46 at 23 to 24.9 kg/m2, 2.06 at 25 to 28.9 kg/m2 (considered overweight but not obese), and 3.56 at a BMI >=29 kg/m2."	0
157680	The relative risk of dying from CVD at 16 years was 4.1 in women with a BMI >=32 compared with <19 kg/m2.	1
157681	Obesity is also a risk factor for the development of heart failure.	0
157682	Hypertension - It has been suggested that control of obesity would eliminate 48 percent of hypertension in whites and 28 percent in blacks.	0
157683	"On average, the blood pressure falls 0.5 to 2.0 mmHg for every 1.0 kg of weight that is lost."	0
157684	"Furthermore, a sustained 4 to 5 mmHg decrease in blood pressure among those with systolic >140 or diastolic >90 leads to statistically significant and clinically important reductions in stroke of 42 percent and MI of 14 percent."	0
157685	"Type 2 diabetes - Obesity is a major risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in both men and women, particularly when combined with a ""western"" diet (characterized by high consumption of red meat, processed meat, high-fat dairy products, sweets, and desserts)."	0
157686	The risk is markedly reduced by weight loss.	0
157687	"In the Nurses' Health study, for example, women who lost more than 5.0 kg reduced their risk for diabetes by 50 percent or more."	1
157688	"Dyslipidemia - Obesity is associated with adverse effects on several lipids including increases in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides, and a reduction in HDL-cholesterol."	0
157689	All patients with CVD should have measurement of waist circumference and calculation of body mass index.	1
157690	The 2011 AHA/ACCF guideline on secondary prevention recommended a target BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 and a waist circumference of <35 inches in women (<89 cm) and <40 inches in men (<102 cm).	0
157691	Patients who exceed these parameters should undergo evaluation for the metabolic syndrome and implementation of weight reduction strategies as an integral component of their multifactorial risk factor reduction.	1
157692	"Weight reduction is optimally achieved with a multiple strategies including diet, increased physical activity, and possible pharmacologic therapy."	0
157693	The AHA/ACCF recommended a 5 to 10 percent reduction in body weight as an initial goal.	0
157694	"Regular physical activity has numerous cardiovascular benefits including weight loss, improvements in lipid profile, reductions in blood pressure, as well as prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes."	0
157695	These issues are discussed in detail separately but the magnitude of the effect can be illustrated by the following observations.	0
157696	A 2005 meta-analysis included 11 randomized trials of 2285 patients with coronary disease (most but not all post-MI) who were assigned to exercise rehabilitation or usual care.	1
157697	"Exercise was associated with a significant 28 percent reduction in all-cause mortality (6.2 versus 9.0 percent, summary risk ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.54-0.95)."	0
157698	"There was also a possible, but nonsignificant, 24 percent reduction in recurrent MI in the exercise rehabilitation group (summary risk ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.57-1.01)."	0
157699	The meta-analysis also included 15 trials of 4655 patients who were randomly assigned to a combined exercise and risk factor education program or to usual care.	1
157700	"Rehabilitation was associated with a possible but nonsignificant 12 percent reduction in all-cause mortality (9.3 versus 10.8 percent, summary risk ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.74-1.04) and a significant 38 percent reduction in recurrent MI (summary risk ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.44-0.87)."	0
157701	"We agree with the 2011 AHA/ACCF guideline on secondary prevention which recommended that, prior to starting an exercise program, all patients should undergo risk assessment with a physical activity history and/or an exercise test."	0
157702	"The 2007 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice, gave specific recommendations for the components of an appropriate exercise program: Exercise should be performed for a minimum of 30 minutes per day, preferably daily but at least five days per week."	0
157703	Exercise should involve moderately intensive aerobic activity such as brisk walking.	0
157704	The ESC guidelines suggest a target heart rate of 60 to 75 percent of the average maximum heart rate or the perception of moderate exercise (12 to 14 on the Borg scale).	0
157705	"Exercise should be supplemented by an increase in daily lifestyle activities (eg, walking breaks at work, gardening, and household work)."	0

160176	"The results of the early comparative clinical trials, which have formed the basis for many of the recommendations for the management of patients with LAD disease, may have limited usefulness in the current era for the following reasons: Many of the studies were conducted at a time when saphenous vein graft use was prevalent rather than internal mammary (thoracic) arteries or other arterial conduits that are now preferred because of improved long-term graft patency and patient survival  . Most previous studies of PCI did not include newer technologies (eg, stenting, especially with drug-eluting stents) and aggressive periprocedural and chronic antithrombotic regimens."	1

160202	"In each of these trials, as well as in a meta-analysis, early outcomes, particularly mortality, have been equivalent, as have late-term survival and freedom from MI."	0
160203	"The only significant difference has been the higher frequency of repeat revascularization procedures following PTCA, generally because of restenosis."	0
160204	"However, extrapolation to current practice is uncertain because of the more recent use of stents, especially drug-eluting stents, and the increasing availability of newer techniques to minimize or even prevent restenosis."	0
160205	"When percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting is performed, drug-eluting stents (DES) are preferred in most patients because of a marked reduction in the incidence of restenosis compared to bare metal stents (BMS), including patients with proximal LAD disease."	0
160206	"The efficacy of DES compared to BMS can be illustrated by the following observations: In a post hoc analysis of data from the SIRIUS trial, 459 patients with an LAD stenosis were randomly assigned to either a sirolimus-eluting stent or a BMS."	1
160207	"Use of the sirolimus-eluting stent was associated with significant reductions in the incidence of angiographic LAD restenosis (2 versus 42 percent at eight months) and the incidence of major adverse events (death, myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularization, 10 versus 25 percent at one year)."	0
160208	Similar benefits were noted among the subset of 536 patients with an LAD lesion in the TAXUS IV trial who were randomly assigned to either a paclitaxel stent or a BMS.	1

160211	"The major stent versus CABG trials in patients with multivessel disease have shown similar long term survival, but higher rates of repeat target vessel revascularization with stents."	1
160212	"Although these outcomes after either CABG or stenting have not been well studied in patients with multivessel disease involving the LAD, some evidence is available from subgroup analyses of such patients enrolled in registries and randomized trials."	1
160213	Few of these patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction <30 percent.	0
160214	"The following are representative comparisons of BMS or DES to CABG, each of which evaluated patients with multivessel disease involving the proximal LAD: A registry study of over 60,000 patients found that CABG compared to BMS was associated with a significantly higher rate of three-year risk-adjusted survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.64) and a much lower rate of target vessel revascularization."	1
160215	"In subgroup analyses of the ERACI II and ARTS I randomized trials, both of which compared CABG to BMS in patients eligible for both procedures, survival at up to three years was comparable, although the rate of revascularization was significantly higher with BMS."	1
160216	"In the ARTS-II study which compared DES to a similar historical population in the CABG arm of the ARTS-I trial, the rate of the primary composite endpoint (all-cause death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal cerebrovascular accident or any repeat revascularization) was not significantly different with CABG (ARTS-I) and DES (ARTS-II) (15 versus 18 percent)."	0
160217	"Among the secondary endpoints, DES were associated with significantly lower rates of death (1.4 versus 5.3 percent), death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (3.1 versus 9.7 percent), and a significantly higher rate of repeat revascularization (13.1 versus 5.3 percent)."	0
160218	The SYNTAX trial randomly assigned 1800 patients with three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease to either CABG or PCI with DES.	1
160219	All patients were eligible for either procedure and were treated with the intention of complete revascularization.	0
160220	"After 12 months of follow up, the composite primary endpoint (death from any cause, stroke, MI or repeat revascularization) was significantly higher in the PCI group (17.8 versus 12.4 percent)."	0
160221	This result was driven by primarily by more frequent revascularization with PCI (13.5 versus 5.9 percent).	0
160222	Patients with lower SYNTAX scores had lower event rates than those with intermediate or high scores.	1
160223	"Secondary analyses suggested that among patients with low SYNTAX scores, the clinical outcomes were comparable with PCI and CABG, whereas in patients with higher SYNTAX score outcomes were better with CABG."	1
160224	"Stenting of the proximal LAD lesion can be performed with a low incidence of major complications, and late results are superior to balloon angioplasty, with an approximate 10 percent absolute reduction in restenosis."	0
160225	"However, the need for revascularization is still lower with CABG than with stenting."	0
160226	"This was illustrated in the SIMA trial that compared bare-metal stenting to CABG using an internal mammary artery in 123 patients with a proximal, isolated LAD stenosis."	1
160227	"After a 2.4 year follow-up, there was no difference in the incidence of death and MI (7 percent in each group) but the need for repeat revascularization was significantly less with CABG (24 versus 0 percent)."	0
160228	This benefit of CABG was maintained at ten year follow-up (17 versus 42 percent).	0
160229	"The concerns about restenosis after PCI are likely to diminish with the availability of drug-eluting stents, which markedly reduce the rate of restenosis."	0
160230	"One small observational study of patients with isolated, proximal LAD disease (left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 30 percent) who underwent CABG using a left internal mammary graft or DES, found a similar rate (2.7 percent) of major adverse cardiovascular events during a mean follow-up of nearly 19 months."	1
160231	"In the patient with severe single vessel disease involving only the proximal LAD, an important consideration is that the patient has to share in the decision making."	1
160232	The patient should be told that a revascularization strategy is preferable to medical therapy alone and that both surgery and PCI are associated with only small risks that are equivalent to each other over the long term.	0
160233	The only differences between the two approaches are: The more invasive approach with surgery with need for cardiopulmonary bypass and its attendant neurologic sequelae and small increased risk of infection.	0
160234	Minimally invasive beating heart surgery is a less morbid alternative that is not widely used.	0
160235	"It remains to be seen if the long-term results with this approach will be equivalent to those with conventional surgery, regardless of whether surgery is performed on or off-pump."	0
160236	The higher chance of requiring one or more subsequent procedures if PCI is chosen.	0
160237	"Thus, the patient must accept the possibility of another revascularization procedure in the future."	0
160238	"However, this disadvantage has diminished with the availability of drug-eluting stents that markedly reduce the incidence of restenosis."	0
160239	"Complex lesions of the proximal LAD, such as ostial location, diffuse disease, or bifurcation lesions, require that the patient be made aware of the greater risk with PCI."	0
160240	Minimally invasive and off-pump (OP) CABG reduce the morbidity associated with standard CABG.	0
160241	Randomized trials using a lateral or anterolateral thoracotomy (MID CABG) in patients with isolated LAD stenosis have suggested that this surgical approach is associated with equivalent mortality but better symptom control and a lower rate of target vessel revascularization than percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stents.	1
160242	A randomized trial comparing PCI with DES to minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery (MIDCAB) evaluated outcomes in 130 patients with isolated proximal LAD disease.	1
160243	"The primary clinical endpoint was freedom from death, myocardial infarction, or the need for target vessel revascularization."	0
160244	"At one year, PCI with DES was noninferior to MIDCAB, with an event rate of 7.7 percent in both groups."	0
160245	"Patients who received PCI had a higher rate of revascularization (6.2 versus 0 percent), while those who received MIDCAB had a higher rate of MI (7.7 versus 1.5 percent), most of which was periprocedural."	1
160246	Insufficient evidence exists to allow for specific recommendations regarding OP CABG in this setting.	0
160247	"Prior to comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with CABG, a few points regarding the anatomy of the LAD as well as potential obstacles to a satisfactory outcome with PCI need to be made: The proximity of an LAD lesion to the left main coronary artery (LMCA) is a determinant of outcome."	0
160248	Lesions >=3 mm distal to the LMCA can usually be safely treated without significant risk to the LMCA.	0
160249	True ostial lesions have been defined as lesions within 3 mm ).	0
160250	The proximity of these lesions to the left main will inevitably result in at least some injury to the distal LMCA by the inflated balloon and/or the stent.	0
160251	"No immediate untoward effects should be anticipated if there is a large caliber left main, particularly without any visible distal disease, calcification, or ostial left circumflex disease."	0
160252	"Complex bifurcation lesions involving the proximal LAD can include ostial LAD disease adjacent to disease involving the ostium of the left circumflex, a large ramus intermedius, or the first diagonal branch )."	0
160253	In addition higher rates of stent thrombosis are observed with bifurcation stent procedures.	0
160254	The management of bifurcation lesions is discussed separately.	0
160255	"In summary, PCI can usually be performed with a high chance of success and low risk of complications in proximal LAD disease."	0
160256	"When faced with more complex lesions such as true ostial location, particularly with involvement of the distal LMCA adjacent circumflex ostial disease, or complex bifurcation lesions involving a large first diagonal branch, consideration of surgical revascularization should be made."	0
160257	Complex LAD-diagonal bifurcation lesions and ostial LAD lesions that are flush with the distal left main should only be attempted by highly experienced operators in institutions with cardiac surgical facilities.	0
160258	Elderly patients who require emergency surgery for failed PCI have an extremely high operative risk.	1
160259	"Thus, surgical revascularization with an internal thoracic artery may be preferable for very complex LAD lesions, particularly if no serious comorbid conditions are present, including chronic renal insufficiency and peripheral vascular disease."	0
160260	"However, need for emergency CABG in the current era is uncommon (<1 percent)."	0
160261	"In patients of advanced age in whom prolonged survival is unlikely, the risk of progressive disease that requires repeat surgery is probably low, particularly with aggressive risk factor modification."	1
160262	PCI options can be used if repeat revascularization is necessary.	0
160263	"Repeat revascularization in patients with prior bypass surgery is most likely to improve survival in subjects at highest risk, such as those with obstruction of the proximal LAD artery and extensive anterior ischemia."	1
160264	Patients with ischemia in other locations and those with a patent LIMA to the LAD artery are unlikely to experience a survival benefit from repeat revascularization.	1
160265	"Surgery might be preferred in patients with complex, proximal LAD disease with other unfavorable lesions (eg, chronic total occlusion in another vessel)."	1
160266	"Other patient and angiographic characteristics also may affect the decision such as age, left ventricular dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus (in which the outcome may be better with CABG)."	1
160267	The following guidelines include recommendations for the management of patients with proximal LAD disease.	1
160268	"Recommendations made in these guidelines do not differ significantly from those made in this topic review, except as noted: 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention guideline for percutaneous coronary intervention."	0
160269	2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guideline for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).	0
160270	2010 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on myocardial revascularization.	0
160271	"This document recommends revascularization to improve prognosis for significant proximal LAD disease, which is defined as any lesion with >50 percent stenosis and documented ischemia or fractional flow reserve <=0.80 for angiographic diameter stenoses 50 to 90 percent."	0
160272	The general approach to patients with proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) disease is similar to that of all patients with coronary heart disease.	1
160273	This should include appropriate secondary prevention strategies and risk stratification.	0
160274	Many patients with severe narrowing of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) have either a large amount of potentially ischemic myocardium or a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50 percent.	1
160275	Most such patients have improved outcomes of either survival or improved quality of life with revascularization therapies as opposed to optimal medical therapy.	0
160276	"For stable patients with severe narrowing of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery who have high-risk criteria of either severe left ventricular dysfunction or evidence of a large area of potentially ischemic myocardium, regardless of anginal severity, we recommend coronary revascularization with either coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as opposed to medical therapy, to improve survival."	1
160277	"For patients in whom a decision has been made to perform revascularization the three following points should be kept in mind: There are no large, randomized trials of PCI versus CABG that are specific for proximal LAD disease."	1
160278	Not all proximal lesions carry the same prognosis or success rate with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).	0
160279	This information may influence decision making between PCI and CABG.	0
160280	"We suggest CABG, as opposed to PCI, for stable patients with a severe narrowing of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery with multivessel CAD who have a moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 to 50 percent or a severely reduced ejection fraction of less than 35 percent."	1
160281	"We suggest CABG, as opposed to PCI, for stable patients with severe narrowing of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery with multivessel CAD who have a large area of myocardium at risk."	1
160282	"For most other patients with proximal LAD disease in whom revascularization has been recommended, we believe that PCI is a reasonable strategy."	1
160283	"However, for those patients who prefer to accept the higher early morbidity (including an increased risk of stroke) with CABG, in exchange for a lower rate of subsequent revascularization, CABG is an appropriate strategy."	1
160284	The discussion of coronary artery revascularization in the large subgroup of patients with diabetes is found elsewhere.	1
168189	Only 40 percent of patients in primary care respond to the first choice of antidepressant medication.	1
168190	"Approximately 20 percent stop the medication due to side effects, and 30 percent have no response."	0
168191	Augmentation of treatment regimens and other treatment strategies are discussed here.	0
168192	"Initial treatment for depression, specific medications used to treat depression, changing antidepressant medications, the indications for treating unipolar major depression with ECT and its efficacy, and the prognosis of depression are discussed separately."	0
168200	Initial severity of depression and chronicity of a depressive episode are associated with a higher risk of treatment resistance.	0
168201	"Patients with higher initial severity and chronicity are also more likely to meet criteria for psychiatric comorbidities such as panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and dysthymia."	1
168202	"In patients who appear to be treatment resistant, adherence to antidepressant medication should be carefully evaluated with nonjudgmental questions such as: ""Many of my patients forget to take their medication on a regular basis. How often does that happen to you?"""	1
168203	"Patients with comorbid anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be especially prone to side effects of medications, leading to nonadherence."	1
168204	"Other important factors that can limit antidepressant response are chronic social stressors such as: Marital discord, which may need to be addressed with psychotherapy."	0
168205	"Patients with severe childhood adversity such as experiences of abuse or neglect, which may need to be addressed with adjunctive psychotherapy to help improve adherence to medication, cope with chronic emotional pain, and improve interpersonal functioning."	1
168206	"Alcohol and/or substance abuse, which may impede recovery with medication and necessitate referral for substance abuse treatment."	0
168207	"Chronic physical pain, which can impede depression recovery due to effects on sleep, physical activity, social interactions and physiologic stress."	0
168208	One of the more common causes of patients failing to respond to usual treatments for major depression is undiagnosed bipolar disorder.	1
168209	"This includes bipolar I disorder, in which the patient has episodes of major depression and mania, and bipolar II disorder, in which the patient has episodes of major depression and hypomania."	0
168210	"Compared with mania, hypomania is shorter in duration and the symptoms are less intense, and thus making it more difficult to diagnose."	0
168211	"Patients with bipolar II may have been previously diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and may complain of distractibility, insomnia, flight of ideas, irritability, social anxiety, or bursts of goal-directed activity or speech."	1
168212	"In addition, the prevalence of substance abuse is high in patients with bipolar II disorder."	1
168213	Careful questioning for hypomanic symptoms is essential;	0
168214	input from family and friends can be important in developing an accurate history of symptoms.	0
168215	Features that are particularly helpful in suggesting bipolar rather than unipolar depression include: A family history of bipolar disorder.	0
168216	More than one family member with suicidality or substance abuse.	0
168217	Sudden onset of depression.	0
168218	"Onset at an earlier age (ie, adolescence rather than the third decade of life that is the modal decade for the onset of unipolar depression),."	0
168219	Rapid resolution of depressive symptoms after a few days of an antidepressant.	0
168220	"In addition, patients may have subthreshold bipolar disorder, defined as episodes of major depression and mood elevated symptoms that do not rise to the threshold of hypomania."	0
168221	"A 10-year prospective family study of a community sample found that among 488 people identified with major depression, 59 percent had pure unipolar major depressive disorder and 41 percent had subthreshold bipolar disorder."	1
168222	"Compared to individuals with pure major depressive disorder, those with subthreshold bipolar depression had a significantly increased family history of mania, and higher rates of nicotine and alcohol use disorders, panic disorder, and legal difficulties."	1
168223	Interrater reliability (agreement) between clinicians in diagnosing subthreshold bipolar disorder may be relatively low because of overlap with other psychiatric disorders.	0
168224	There is little evidence to indicate how clinicians should treat patients with subthreshold bipolar disorder.	1
168225	"In this context, we suggest the use of adjunctive lithium."	0
168226	"Patients with bipolar disorder often experience substantial side effects with typical antidepressant medication regimens, and have more rapid cycles of mood swings with SSRIs."	1
168227	Therapy for bipolar II should include mood stabilizers such as lamotrigine or lithium.	0
168228	A meta-analysis has shown that evidence-based psychotherapies and antidepressant medications are equally effective for patients with mild to moderate major depression.	1
168229	"Outcomes for patients with severe recurrent and treatment resistant depression, however, are significantly improved with treatment combining pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy."	1
168230	"An increment in treatment efficacy with combination treatment was demonstrated in a trial that randomly assigned 681 patients with chronic major depression for two or more years to nefazodone (maximal dose 600 mg per day), cognitive behavioral analysis therapy (CBAS), or a combination of both."	1
168231	"The overall rate of response was 48 percent for patients who received at least one treatment session with CBAS alone, or who received nefazodone alone, compared to 73 percent in the combined treatment group."	1
168232	"Differences were more striking for patients who completed the 12 week study: response rates for nefazodone, psychotherapy, and combined treatment were 55, 52, and 85 percent, respectively, and withdrawal rates were the same for all three groups."	1
168233	"Because of its potential adverse effect on the liver, however, nefazodone has been withdrawn from most world markets."	0
168234	"In another study, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was not as effective as pharmacotherapy (fluoxetine or bupropion), particularly for depression with greater chronicity, in a group of men sequentially assigned to either treatment strategy."	0
168235	"Results from the STAR*D trial arms (see below) indicate that, for patients who did not respond to an initial trial of citalopram pharmacotherapy, outcome was the same for patients who elected CBT as either a switch or augmentation strategy, compared to patients who switched or augmented with medication."	1
168236	Response was more rapid for patients choosing augmentation with a second medication than with CBT;	1
168237	patients who elected to switch medications experienced more side effects than those who switched to CBT.	1
168238	"However, fewer patients than expected chose to participate in the CBT arms of the trial."	1
168239	"Randomized trials suggest that for euthymic patients with a history of at least three unipolar major depressive episodes, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy may possibly delay or prevent recurrence of major depression as effectively as medication."	1
168240	Trials that evaluated the therapy in patients with only two prior episodes found that it was not beneficial.	1
168241	"A number of pharmacologic strategies, with varying levels of supportive evidence, have been used in patients with treatment resistant depression."	1
168242	"The STAR*D trial, conducted in 18 primary care and 23 outpatient psychiatry practices, is a large study of sequential treatment strategies in a highly representative sample of outpatients with nonpsychotic major depression."	0
168243	"The randomized trial was designed to compare long term outcomes of various treatments, and to determine patient characteristics that might predict better response to one treatment over another."	0
168244	Patients were initially treated with citalopram as monotherapy.	0
168245	"Patients who failed to remit were encouraged to move through a cascade of subsequent treatments, identified as levels."	1
168246	"Patients in Level 2 were offered the option of switching treatment (to bupropion SR, sertraline, venlafaxine, or to cognitive behavioral therapy) or of augmenting citalopram with bupropion, buspirone, or CBT."	1
168247	"Patients who didn't remit were then offered Level 3 treatment: switch to mirtazapine or nortriptyline, or augmentation with lithium, triiodothyronine, sertraline or venlafaxine."	1
168248	Level 4 treatment was a switch to tranylcypromine or combination of mirtazapine plus venlafaxine.	0
168249	It has been suggested that primary care physicians might best refer patients to psychopharmacology specialists for patients requiring treatment beyond Level 2.	1
168250	"Results from the STAR-D trial are still being published, but several interim findings are discussed below."	0
168251	"Overall findings include the recognition that patients at any level who experienced clinical remission had a better long-term prognosis than patients with partial response, but that there was reluctance on the part of clinicians and patients to push treatment towards full remission."	1
168252	Longer drug exposure times than had been initially thought were required to achieve remission;	0
168253	"a modest improvement at six weeks may require a dose increase or further time (up to twelve weeks) at the same dose, for a full response."	0
168254	"Patients who fail a trial of one antidepressant can often respond to a second, whether of the same class or different class."	1
168255	"The STAR*D trial randomly assigned 727 patients who either did not achieve remission or could not tolerate a 14 week trial of citalopram to substitute one of three antidepressants: sustained release bupropion, sertraline, or venlafaxine."	1
168256	"After treatment with one of these medications for up to 14 weeks, remission was achieved in 25 percent of patients, and response in another 25 percent;"	0
168257	there was no difference in tolerance or response rates between the three medication groups.	0
168258	"Thus, patients who did not initially tolerate one SSRI (citalopram) were able to tolerate and respond to a second SSRI (eg, sertraline) to the same extent as other antidepressants were tolerated."	1
168259	"A meta-analysis of four randomized trials that included the STAR*D trial above (n=1496), however, found that remission rates were higher when patients who had not responded to an initial SSRI were switched to a non-SSRI compared to a switch to another SSRI (RR 1.29)."	1
168260	"The difference in remission rates was only modest, however;"	0
168261	"the number needed to be treated with a non-SSRI, rather than a second SSRI, is 21 to obtain one additional remission."	0
168262	After two negative SSRI trials it is preferable to choose an agent that works by modulating different neurotransmitters.	0
168263	Some evidence suggests that agents with dual action on both serotonin and norepinephrine may be more effective in patients with more severe depression.	1
168264	"These dual agent medications include first generation tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine, clomipramine, and amitriptyline as well as venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and duloxetine."	0
168265	"Patients needing a switch to a third medication at Level 3 in the STAR*D trial, based on nonresponse, had a lower remission rate to treatment, and there was no difference between response to mirtazapine or nortriptyline."	1
168266	"Other options for antidepressants include agents that have primary action on non-serotonergic neurotransmission, such as bupropion which raises levels of dopamine and noradrenaline through reuptake inhibition of these neurotransmitters."	0
168267	"Care should be taken when switching from one antidepressant to another, as many of these drugs have overlapping side effect profiles and/or drug interactions."	0
168268	"In addition, the underlying depression should not be left untreated during the switch, if possible."	0
168269	Psychopharmacologists frequently use augmentation strategies in which one medication with a different mechanism of action is added to the first in treatment resistant patients.	0
168270	"Augmentation options include the addition of another antidepressant, lithium, an atypical antipsychotic, thyroid hormone, or a stimulant drug."	0
168271	"In a study of VA patients (n = 250,000) treated for depression in 2002, 22 percent were treated with an augmentation medication for at least 60 days."	1
168272	"The most commonly selected augmentation drugs were a second antidepressant (11 percent), an atypical antipsychotic (7 percent), and lithium (0.5 percent)."	0
168273	"Adding a second antidepressant, from a different class than the original medication, has been shown to be effective."	0
168274	A second step of the STAR*D trial randomly assigned 565 outpatients who did not achieve remission despite a mean of 12 weeks of citalopram therapy to receive augmentation with either sustained release bupropion (up to 400 mg per day) or buspirone (up to 60 mg per day).	1
168275	Remission was achieved in approximately 30 percent of patients in both groups;	1
168276	"patients who received bupropion had a lower dropout rate due to intolerance, and achieved lower scores on a depression symptom rating scale."	1
168277	"Tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline (which primarily increases noradrenaline) may also be added to an SSRI."	0
168278	"If a tricyclic antidepressant is added to an SSRI, it is important to carefully monitor side effects and tricyclic serum levels because the SSRI can increase these levels."	0
168279	S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) is a naturally occurring molecule that appears to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for depression.	0
168280	It is available in the United States as an oral dietary supplement.	0
168281	"In a six-week randomized trial, 73 patients with unipolar major depression who failed adequate treatment with an SSRI received adjunctive SAMe (800 mg twice per day) or placebo."	1
168282	Remission occurred in significantly more patients who received SAMe compared with placebo (36 versus 12 percent).	1
168283	"In addition, discontinuation of treatment because of adverse side effects occurred in fewer patients who received SSRI plus SAMe (5 versus 9 percent)."	1
168284	It is not known whether adjunctive SAMe is efficacious for treatment periods lasting longer than six weeks.	0
168285	"Clinicians may consider SAMe augmentation for patients with treatment resistant depression who do not respond to augmentation with either lithium or a second-generation antipsychotic, based upon the more extensive evidence supporting the use of lithium or a second-generation antipsychotic."	1
168286	Second-generation antipsychotics are efficacious as augmentation for acute unipolar major depression that does not respond to initial treatment with an antidepressant.	0
168287	"A meta-analysis of 16 randomized trials examined the efficacy of adjunctive aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone in 3480 patients with nonpsychotic, unipolar major depression who failed at least one course of monotherapy with various antidepressants (usually a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor)."	1
168288	Remission occurred in significantly more patients who received an adjunctive antipsychotic compared with adjunctive placebo (31 versus 17 percent).	1
168289	Discontinuation because of adverse side effects was significantly higher in patients who received an adjunctive antipsychotic compared with adjunctive placebo (9 versus 2 percent).	1
168290	"Use of second-generation antipsychotics as add-on therapy to treat unipolar, nonpsychotic major depression that is unresponsive to an antidepressant is discussed elsewhere."	0
168291	"The use of lithium for augmentation of antidepressants has been studied more often than other augmentation strategies, and lithium is the only medication which has been shown to decrease the rate of suicide in major depression."	0
168292	"A meta-analysis examined 10 controlled trials of augmentation of antidepressants (primarily tricyclics) in 269 depressed patients (194 unipolar, 14 bipolar, and 61 polarity not reported)."	1
168293	Significantly more patients responded to adjunctive lithium compared with placebo (41 versus 14 percent).	0
168294	"However, the use of lithium for augmentation may be declining due to the need for serum levels, side effects on initiation (GI, tremor, polyuria), and availability of other drug options."	0
168295	"The dose, duration, side effects, efficacy, and reduced risk of suicide associated with lithium are discussed elsewhere."	0
168296	Augmentation with triiodothyronine (T3) may be effective and well tolerated in patients with major depression.	1
168297	"In the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) Study, an open-label, randomized trial compared adjunctive T3 with lithium in 73 patients and found that a comparable number remitted with either T3 or lithium (25 versus 16 percent), and that T3 was better tolerated."	0
168298	"However, the lithium doses used in the comparison trial may have been lower than generally used, and serum lithium levels were not regularly confirmed for therapeutic levels."	0
168299	"The use of T3 as add-on therapy to treat unipolar major depression, as well as the efficacy of adjunctive T3 compared with adjunctive lithium, are discussed separately."	0
168300	Two randomized trials involving 411 patients with treatment resistant depression (and fatigue in most cases) compared augmentation of antidepressant treatment with modafinil or placebo.	1
168301	"There was no significant difference in reducing depressive symptoms, indicating that modafinil augmentation is not efficacious in treatment resistant-depression."	0
168302	Methylphenidate as adjunctive treatment was also not effective in reducing depressive symptoms.	0
168303	"The delay in therapeutic effect of many available antidepressants may be due to their targeted action on the monoaminergic system, which is thought to be upstream from the ultimate central nervous system site responsible for response to pharmacotherapy."	0
168304	"A potential, more immediate target is the glutamatergic system, particularly the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor."	0
168305	Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist that is used as an anesthetic and may possibly be effective for unipolar major depression (as well as bipolar major depression.	0
168306	"Evidence for the efficacy of ketamine includes the following: A crossover trial compared a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) with a single infusion of saline, administered one week apart, in 18 patients with treatment resistant unipolar major depression;"	1
168307	patients were randomly assigned to the order in which they received the two infusions.	0
168308	Improvement of depression symptom rating scale scores was significantly greater with ketamine.	0
168309	"In addition, response (improvement from baseline on the depression rating scale >= 50 percent) occurred in 71 percent of patients who received ketamine within one day of the infusion, and persisted for one week in 35 percent."	1
168310	"Transient side effects that were more common with ketamine than saline included confusion, elevated blood pressure, euphoria, dizziness, and increased libido."	0
168311	An open label study that administered a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) to 42 patients with treatment resistant unipolar major depression found that response (improvement from baseline on the depression rating scale >= 50 percent) occurred within four hours in 62 percent.	1
168312	Other open label studies of intravenous ketamine in treatment resistant depression have also found clinically moderate to large benefits.	0
168313	"However, the long-term beneficial and adverse effects of ketamine are not known, due to lack of follow-up in these studies."	0
168314	Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is more efficacious than any other treatment used for severe major depression.	0
168315	"An overview of ECT, the indications for treating unipolar major depression with ECT, its efficacy, and the technique for administering it are discussed separately."	0
168316	Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) uses an electric coil to generate magnetic fields that stimulate the cerebral cortex.	0
168317	"It is very well tolerated by patients and, in contrast to ECT, does not require the use of anesthesia and does not appear to cause cognitive impairment."	0
168318	"Randomized, controlled studies of rTMS compared to placebo sham procedures have produced conflicting results."	0
168319	"A systematic review concluded that there is no strong evidence of benefit with rTMS in depressed patients, although the small sample sizes in most of the studies do not exclude the possibility of benefit."	0
168320	A subsequent randomized trial of rTMS in 60 patients with treatment resistant depression did show a significantly higher rate of response in two active treatment groups (high-frequency left-sided rTMS and low frequency stimulation to the right prefrontal cortex) compared with placebo;	1
168321	"the absolute benefit, however, appeared to be relatively small."	0
168322	"Treatment response (at least 50 percent improvement in Hamilton Rating Depression Scale [HAMD] score) was demonstrated in 31 percent of the active treatment group, compared with 6 percent of the sham treatment group, in another randomized trial of rTMS for treatment of resistant depression."	0
168323	"A large multicenter international trial compared rTMS (20 to 30 sessions over 4 to 6 weeks) with sham procedure in 301 patients with treatment-resistant depression, who were off medication."	1
168324	The primary outcome (50 percent improvement in score on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score at 4 weeks) occurred in 18 percent of patients who received rTMS compared to 11 percent of controls.	1
168325	"Secondary outcomes (HAMD scores at 4 and 6 weeks; MADRS score at 6 weeks, and remission rates at six weeks) were also significantly higher for the treatment group, compared to control."	0
168326	rTMS has also been compared with ECT.	0
168327	"In a randomized trial comparing a 15-day course of rTMS or a standard course of ECT, remission was achieved in 59 percent of the ECT group compared to 17 percent of patients receiving rTMS at the end of treatment."	1
168328	"HAM-D scores did not differ at six months, although other mood scores were lower for the ECT group;"	0
168329	cognitive measures were the same for both groups.	0
168330	"In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration cleared one device (NeuroStar TMS) for use in patients who have not benefited from prior antidepressant treatment."	1
168331	"A treatment course usually consists of 6 weeks of 40 minute sessions (five days a week), and rTMS has caused seizures with some devices."	0
168332	High frequency electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used for treatment of patients with Parkinson disease.	1
168333	The procedure involves stereotaxic placement of electrodes that are connected to a permanently implanted neurostimulator.	0
168334	There is preliminary evidence that some patients with treatment-resistant depression may benefit from DBS.	1
168335	"The optimal site of electrode placement for treatment of major depression is unclear, with studies targeting either the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) or the subcallosal white matter."	0
168336	A case series of 20 patients with major depression unresponsive to more than 4 antidepressants and ECT (17 of the 20 patients) who underwent DBS with subcallosal electrode placement found response and remission rates to be 60 and 35 percent respectively at six months.	1
168337	"Adverse effects included infection (5), generalized seizure (1), and headache or pain at the implant site (4)."	0
168338	Response and remission rates of 40 and 20 percent respectively at six months with VC/VS electrode placement were reported in another group of 15 patients with refractory depression.	1
168339	"Adverse events, affecting 6 patients, included pain at implant site, lead fracture, increased depression or suicidality, and syncope."	0
168340	"DBS should be considered only in patients refractory to all other interventions, with fully informed consent, and supported by an interdisciplinary team (including neurosurgery and psychiatry) able to provide close patient monitoring over time."	0
168341	"Pending further evaluation related to patient selection, procedure specifics, and treatment outcomes, DBS is not recommended for refractory depression outside of the research setting."	0
168342	Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been used for the treatment of epilepsy.	0
168343	VNS has also been studied for the treatment of refractory depression.	0
168344	"A 10-week randomized trial of VNS in 235 treatment-resistant depressed patients found no statistically significant difference in response, defined as a 50 percent reduction in the HAM-D assessment score, comparing treatment with sham stimulation (15 versus 10 percent)."	0
168345	"We do not recommend VNS for the treatment of depression, based on available data."	0
168346	"Although the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved VNS in 2005 for adjunctive use in patients with depression who failed at least four adequate antidepressant trials, it remains unclear from the literature how effective this treatment modality is."	1
168347	"Moreover, other somatic treatments, such as ECT, are likely more effective in this treatment-resistant population."	0

169623	"Depression is associated with both emotional symptoms (mood changes) and physical symptoms (ie, fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, muscle tension)."	0
169624	Depression increases both the perception and impact of physical symptoms.	0
169625	"Depression is a physical illness, associated with biologic changes in neurochemistry in the brain."	0
169626	Treatment with medication and/or psychotherapy generally shortens the course of depression and diminishes symptoms.	0

169628	"A patient diary that records sleep, mood, appetite, and concentration difficulties during this period may be useful in encouraging patients to accept treatment."	0
169629	Framing medication trials or counseling as having diagnostic value for depression may also be helpful.	0
169630	"Patients who will be treated with medication should be told the following, at the initiation of treatment: Do not stop medications without talking with the prescribing clinician."	1

169634	Call to discuss side effects or other questions.	0
169635	"Despite evidence of an increased risk of relapse if medication is discontinued prematurely, one study indicated that 42 percent of patients had discontinued their antidepressant by 30 days and 72 percent by 90 days."	0
169636	"Half of these patients discontinued medications because they felt better, and believed medications could be taken as needed thereafter."	0

169639	"Patients should be encouraged to engage in exercise and positive activities (""behavioral activation"") that may have been stopped due to depression."	0
169640	"However, exercise alone is not an effective treatment strategy for most patients with major depression."	1
169641	Relaxation techniques may be tried for patients with minimal symptoms.	1
169642	"A meta-analysis of 11 trials found that relaxation reduced self-reported symptoms compared to no treatment, but was not as effective as psychological treatment."	0

169644	"The STAR*D trial, conducted in 18 primary care and 23 outpatient psychiatry practices, is a large study of sequential treatment strategies in a representative sample of outpatients with nonpsychotic major depression."	0
169645	"The randomized trial was designed to compare long term outcomes of various treatments, and to determine patient characteristics that might predict selective response to one treatment over another."	0
169646	"Overall findings include the recognition that patients who experienced clinical remission had a better long-term prognosis than patients with partial response, but that there was reluctance on the part of clinicians and patients to push treatment towards full remission."	1
169647	"Psychotherapy, alone or in combination with antidepressant medication, is an option for patients with mild to moderate major depression."	1
169648	A review of 12 psychotherapy trials completed in primary care found that depression-specific psychotherapies produced outcomes similar to pharmacotherapy and better than usual primary care.	0
169649	Patient preference and insurance coverage may influence the decision for psychotherapy.	0
169650	"Patients who do not respond after twelve weeks of initial psychotherapy should be started on an antidepressant, as part of a combined treatment approach."	1
169651	"Starting antidepressants earlier than twelve weeks may be considered as well, because many patients do not optimally benefit from psychotherapy without a concurrent antidepressant."	0
169652	"Patients with severe, chronic (more than two years), or recurrent depression should be treated with a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy."	1
169653	A broad range of psychological interventions appear to be effective for the treatment of depression.	0
169654	"The Depression Guideline Panel of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) concluded that for patients with major depression, the efficacy of cognitive therapy, behavioral therapy, and interpersonal therapy was 46, 55, and 52 percent, respectively."	1
169655	"Family and couples therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and problem-solving therapy are also effective."	0
169656	"In addition, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy may possibly delay or prevent recurrence of major depression as effectively as medication."	0
169657	"Interpersonal psychotherapy also appears to prevent recurrence of major depression, but not as effectively as medication."	0
169658	"A 2007 representative survey of the United States general population found that among outpatients treated for unipolar depressive disorders, the proportion using psychotherapy alone was 6 percent, and the proportion using psychotherapy plus pharmacotherapy was 43 percent."	1
169659	"These percentages are conservative estimates, because they do not include patients treated for an adjustment disorder, many if not most of whom were probably suffering from a depressive syndrome."	1
169660	Pharmacotherapy and manual-based psychotherapy are each efficacious for treating depression.	0
169661	"Multiple randomized trials of patients in the primary care setting have found similar efficacy for each treatment, with no clear predictors of which treatment is best for individual patients."	1
169662	"Guidelines from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom recommend psychotherapy as initial treatment for patients with mild depression, citing that the risk benefit ratio does not warrant pharmacotherapy for mild symptoms."	1
169663	"The AHCPR Guideline Panel recommends drug therapy alone as the initial treatment for severely depressed patients, and either medication or psychotherapy for mild or moderate depression."	1
169664	"The panel notes the importance of regular follow-up for patients treated with medication to assure compliance, assess response, and develop a supportive relationship with their clinician."	1
169665	"A systematic review of 12 randomized trials comparing antidepressant treatment alone with antidepressant treatment combined with psychotherapy found a higher response rate for patients in the combination group (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.38-2.52);"	1
169666	the severity or chronicity of depression was not noted in this review.	0
169667	Combined treatment is both more costly and time consuming.	0
169668	"An earlier meta-analysis comparing psychotherapy alone with antidepressant plus psychotherapy found no significant difference in response rates for mild depression, but significantly increased response to combination therapy for more severe and recurrent depression."	0
169669	"Most data favor combination therapy for patients with severe, chronic (more than two years) or recurrent symptoms."	1
169670	"The major classes of drugs used to treat depression are considered ""first generation"" (monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs], and tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) and ""second generation"" (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], inhibitors of the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine [SNRIs], and a few drugs with unique modes of action)."	0
169671	Antidepressants are beneficial for patients with unipolar major depression.	1
169672	"In a meta-analysis of patient level data from 37 randomized trials (8477 patients with major depression) that compared either fluoxetine (modal dose 20 mg per day) or venlafaxine (modal dose range 75 to 150 mg per day) with placebo for six weeks, the primary findings included the following: Remission occurred in more patients who received active drug than placebo (43 versus 29 percent)."	0
169673	Response (improvement from baseline on the depression rating scale >=50 percent) occurred in more patients who received active treatment than placebo (58 versus 40 percent).	1
169674	"For patients with acute major depression in the primary care setting, antidepressants are associated with a 50 to 60 percent response rate."	1
169675	"In one multicenter ""real-world"" study (N = 2876 outpatients treated with citalopram), remission occurred in 28 percent, with a mean time to remission of seven weeks."	1
169676	Publication bias should be considered in evaluating the literature regarding antidepressant trials.	0
169677	"A 2008 meta-analysis of second generation antidepressants found that 69 percent of the 203 trials meeting inclusion criteria were supported by pharmaceutical companies, 9 percent by governmental or independent sponsors, and the funding source was not identifiable for 22 percent."	0
169678	"In a study comparing published antidepressant drug trials with drug trials registered with the FDA, 94 percent of published trials reported positive results, compared with 51 percent of trials tracked by the FDA."	0
169679	"Thus, as with other drugs, published trials of antidepressants are likely to show a greater effect size than may be actually present."	0
169680	"Antidepressants appear to be efficacious for unipolar major depression regardless of baseline severity, including patients with mild major depression."	1
169681	"The belief that pharmacotherapy benefits only severely ill patients stems in part from a meta-analysis of six randomized trials (718 patients, nearly all with major depression) that compared antidepressants with placebo;"	1
169682	results suggested a substantial benefit in very severe depression and little or no benefit in mild to moderate depression.	0
169683	"However, a subsequent, larger meta-analysis of 37 randomized trials (8477 patients with major depression) that compared antidepressants with placebo found that remission at six weeks occurred in more: Mildly ill patients who received active drug than placebo (50 versus 37 percent)."	1
169684	Severely ill patients who received active drug than placebo (38 versus 25 percent).	1
169685	These differences may underestimate antidepressant effects over longer time periods.	0
169686	"Although the larger meta-analysis is more believable than the earlier one and we are confident that antidepressants are efficacious for unipolar major depression of mild severity, nevertheless, there are hundreds of other randomized trials that were not included in the two meta-analyses."	0
169687	An analysis that included these other trials would provide a better basis for evaluating the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in mild major depression.	0
169688	"Most systematic reviews have concluded that clinical and quality of life outcomes, as well as overall treatment costs, provide no clear guidance on the choice among specific antidepressants."	0
169689	"As an example, a meta-analysis of 93 randomized trials (>20,000 patients with unipolar major depression) found treatment effects among second-generation antidepressants were comparable."	1
169690	"However, results from these systematic reviews are limited to acute treatment (6 to 12 weeks), and thus do not address long-term outcomes and cumulative side effects."	0
169691	"The choice of antidepressant is likely to be less important than treating patients with medications that they can tolerate, and with doses sufficient to achieve symptom remission."	1
169692	SSRIs are often first line in primary care because they cause fewer side effects than other drugs and are less dangerous with overdose.	0
169693	"The 2008 clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Physicians (ACP) make a strong recommendation to initiate one of 12 second-generation antidepressants (bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone, or venlafaxine), based on their similar efficacy and side effect profiles."	0
169694	"We do not recommend use of nefazodone, however, due to its hepatotoxicity."	0
169695	Multiple meta-analyses have evaluated comparisons of antidepressant medications.	0
169696	Findings include: The guidelines for the ACP were based on a meta-analysis of 203 randomized trials comparing efficacy and effectiveness of 12 second generation antidepressants.	0
169697	Most trials compared drugs with placebo and 70 percent were supported by pharmaceutical companies.	0
169698	"Drugs were similar in regard to acute and maintenance phase response rates, impact on quality of life indices, and treatment response for associated symptoms (anxiety, insomnia, pain)."	0
169699	Small effect size differences were not considered to be clinically relevant.	0
169700	"Another meta-analysis included 117 randomized trials in which two or more of the following 12 second-generation antidepressants, used as monotherapy, were evaluated: bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine."	0
169701	"In the absence of head-to-head drug trials, multiple treatment (network) meta-analysis was used to compare two dichotomous outcomes (response, defined as >50 percent improvement in symptom score; and patient drop out during treatment)."	0
169702	Escitalopram and sertraline showed the best combined profile of acceptability and efficacy.	0
169703	"Methodological concerns with indirect comparisons (including heterogeneity in patient populations and comparability of drug doses), pharmaceutical sponsorship of most trials, and inadequate reporting of randomization techniques or allocation concealment may limit the validity of these findings."	0
169704	"In addition, it is unclear whether the differences between drugs were clinically meaningful or would be sustained beyond the eight week-average study period."	0
169705	Two meta-analyses evaluated randomized trials of sertraline escitalopram versus other antidepressive agents.	0
169706	"The studies found both sertraline and escitalopram more effective than the comparator drugs, although it is uncertain if differences were clinically significant."	0
169707	"In a meta-analysis of 28 randomized, controlled trials involving 5940 primary care patients with major depression, dysthymia, or mixed anxiety depression, newer antidepressants (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase, and dopamine antagonists) resulted in higher rates of response than placebo (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1), but rates were similar to those for tricyclic agents."	1
169708	"A systematic review of 55 randomized, controlled trials of MAO inhibitors versus tricyclic antidepressants found that MAO inhibitors were less effective for severe depressive disorders but possibly more effective in atypical depressive disorders."	0
169709	"A systematic review of 46 randomized controlled trials and 24 observational studies of head-to-head comparisons between second-generation antidepressants (SSRIs, bupropion, duloxetine, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine) concluded that there were no significant differences in efficacy or tolerability among these drugs."	0
169710	"By contrast, a meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials (2626 patients with major depression) found that response occurred in significantly more patients who received mirtazapine than an SSRI (OR 1.2)."	1
169711	There is limited evidence that tricyclics may be preferred for more severely depressed patients.	0
169712	"A meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials for treatment of hospitalized, depressed patients found tricyclics were significantly more efficacious compared to SSRIs, but the clinical difference was small."	0
169713	The role of tricyclic antidepressants in treating major depression is discussed separately.	0
169714	Patients who have been successfully treated with a well-tolerated drug in the past should resume that agent if depression recurs.	1
169715	A positive response to a particular antidepressant by a first degree relative may be another factor to consider.	0
169716	Some meta-analyses suggest small differences in clinical efficacy that are unlikely to have clinical relevance.	0
169717	"Since efficacy differences are not a clinically important issue, other factors to be considered in drug selection include physician familiarity, cost, formulary preference, and side effects."	0
169718	"Numerous drug-drug interactions may occur with antidepressant use, involving concurrent use of more than one antidepressant, or other types of medication."	0
169719	"Prior to prescribing an antidepressant, potential interactions with a patient's preexisting medication regimen should be checked using the drug interaction database available through UpToDate or in other programs."	0
169720	Specific antidepressants may cause more weight gain than others.	0
169721	"A systematic review of second-generation antidepressants evaluated 203 studies and found that mirtazapine and paroxetine were associated more weight gain than other drugs such as fluoxetine, sertraline, trazodone, and venlafaxine."	0
169722	A related issue is the risk of diabetes.	0
169723	It appears that depression itself is a risk factor for developing diabetes.	0
169724	"A cohort study of 1000 people 65 years and older, followed prospectively for up to ten years, found that depressed individuals were more than twice as likely to develop diabetes compared to those without depression, regardless of antidepressant treatment (hazard ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.1)."	0
169725	"In addition, specific antidepressants or antidepressants as a class of medications may possibly be associated with an increased risk of diabetes."	0
169726	"A nested case-control study found that among approximately 166,000 patients with depression and no sign of diabetes, long-term use (>24 months) of an antidepressant in moderate to high doses was associated with a significantly increased risk of diabetes (incidence rate ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.5)."	1
169727	"Analysis of individual antidepressants found an increased risk estimate for amitriptyline (incidence rate ratio: 1.43, 1.03-1.98), fluvoxamine (incidence rate ratio: 4.91, 1.05-23.03), paroxetine (incidence rate ratio: 1.33, 1.02-1.73), and venlafaxine (incidence rate ratio: 2.03, 1.18-3.48)."	0
169728	A study using a claims data base found an association between antidepressants and stroke.	0
169729	"Problems with the study, including confounds and the possibility of reverse causality, lead us to suggest that clinicians should not change their practice with regard to this issue until better designed studies have been conducted."	0
169730	The SSRIs tend to have similar side effect profiles.	0
169731	"However, certain SSRIs may be more likely to cause specific side effects."	0
169732	"Thus, some patients who cannot tolerate one SSRI may do well with another."	1
169733	Side effects of SSRIs are discussed separately.	0
169734	"SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine, and desvenlafaxine) have many similar side effects to SSRIs because of the serotonergic effect of these medications."	0
169735	"These side effects include jitteriness, restlessness, headache, insomnia and sexual side effects, particularly delayed orgasm."	0
169736	"SNRIs also have noradrenergic side effects, particularly at high dosages, including increased sweating and dizziness."	0
169737	Venlafaxine may cause hypertension at dosages of 300 mg or greater.	0
169738	Potentially lethal cardiac effects have been reported with overdose of venlafaxine.	0
169739	"Duloxetine may slightly impair glycemic control in patients with diabetes, and has been associated with fatal liver failure in patients with preexisting liver disease and is contraindicated in this subgroup of patients."	1
169740	"The most common side effects of cyclic antidepressants include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, tachycardia, and confusion or delirium."	0
169741	These are the result of anticholinergic activity.	0
169742	"The elderly are particularly susceptible to memory impairment, confusion, and hallucinations."	0
169743	Side effects of tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants are discussed separately.	0
169744	"MAO inhibitors are often avoided because of their potential to precipitate enhanced sympathetic activity and severe hypertension with the concomitant ingestion of tyramine-containing foods (eg, fermented cheeses, imported beer, Chianti, champagne, some other wines, soy sauce, avocados, bananas, overripe or spoiled food, and any fermented, smoked, or aged fish or meat)."	0
169745	The hypertensive reaction is dose-dependent and can be exacerbated if the patient is also taking a sympathomimetic drug.	0
169746	"MAO inhibitors are best managed by specialists with experience in prescribing these medications, and are not considered to be first-line therapy for depressed patients."	0
169747	"Bupropion has significantly fewer adverse effects related to sexual dysfunction than SSRIs, and may be particularly effective for patients who are lethargic."	1
169748	"Additionally, bupropion is not associated with weight gain."	0
169749	"Mirtazapine, a mixed serotonin-norepinephrine antagonist, is sedating."	0
169750	It has efficacy equivalent to SSRIs and may have a role in the treatment of patients with insomnia and depression.	1
169751	Mirtazapine causes more weight gain than SSRIs.	0
169752	Nefazodone has been associated with fatal liver failure and is no longer available in several countries.	0
169753	"Agomelatine does not appear to cause sexual side effects or weight gain, but may elevate serum transaminase levels more than three times the upper limit of normal."	0
169754	"Pharmacology, dosing, and adverse effects of these medications are discussed in more detail separately."	0
169755	Starting at low doses can minimize the side effects of antidepressants.	0
169756	"Typical starting doses are shown in a table, but even lower doses may minimize side effects, particularly in the elderly."	0
169757	"For the SSRIs, for example, it is reasonable to initially prescribe 5 to 10 mg of paroxetine, 12.5 to 25 mg of sertraline, 25 mg of fluvoxamine, 5 mg of fluoxetine, or 10 mg of citalopram for approximately one week, and gradually titrate up to full doses."	0
169758	The drugs are usually taken in the morning;	0
169759	they can be mildly stimulating for the first 8 to 12 hours after oral ingestion and may disturb sleep.	0
169760	Doses of SSRIs that are higher than typical may be necessary to achieve remission.	0
169761	"In the Sequential Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial (STAR*D) involving outpatient treatment for 2876 patients with major depression, 80 percent of whom had chronic depression with recurrent episodes, the average dose of citalopram needed to achieve remission was 42 mg daily."	1
169762	"However, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued warnings that citalopram causes dose-dependent QT interval prolongation that can lead to arrhythmias, and thus recommends that the maximum dose should not exceed 40 mg per day."	0
169763	Additional information about the citalopram warnings and cardiac effects of SSRIs is discussed separately.	0
169764	Lower doses of tricyclic antidepressants may work as well as higher doses.	0
169765	"A meta-analysis of 35 studies (2013 patients) concluded that doses equivalent to <=100 mg of imipramine were as effective as higher doses, and both were more effective than placebo."	0
169766	Patients need to be monitored (by phone or visit) at least every one to two weeks for six to eight weeks during the initiation phase of new pharmacologic treatment.	0
169767	The AHCPR Panel recommended that more severely depressed patients be seen at least twice a month for supportive care.	0
169768	The PHQ-9 tool may be used to assess depression response over time.	0
169769	The lag time before an initial therapeutic response to antidepressant therapy is observed has been thought to be two to six weeks.	0
169770	"However, a meta-analysis of 50 placebo-controlled randomized trials found that about one-third of the maximal therapeutic response is observed after the first week of therapy."	0
169771	Two industry-sponsored trials found that early treatment response (within two weeks) predicts likelihood of achieving a stable response and sustained remission.	0
169772	"Treatment time to maximal response may be six weeks or longer: In a study of 182 outpatients with major depression who had a sustained acute response to fluoxetine therapy, the probability of response was 56 percent at two weeks, 81 percent at four weeks, and 90 percent at six weeks."	1
169773	"Thus, more than half of eventual responders begin to respond by week two."	0
169774	"In the multicenter STAR*D trial, 56 percent of those who responded (more than 50 percent improvement) did so at or after eight weeks of treatment with citalopram."	0
169775	More than 80 percent of this population had chronic depression with relapsing episodes.	0
169776	The mean time to achieve response was 5.7 weeks and the mean treatment time to remission was 6.7 weeks.	0
169777	Therapy should be modified if the response to an initial medication is inadequate.	0
169778	Dosages should be increased if there is lack of response after two weeks.	0
169779	"If there is no response by 8 to 10 weeks at a maximum therapeutic dose, the patient should be given a trial of another antidepressant (either of the same or different class) or should be referred to a psychiatrist."	0
169780	"For partial responders, patients may be augmented with bupropion or buspirone, or changed to another SSRI, SNRI, or bupropion if they prefer not to be on a second antidepressant."	0
169781	"Although the data are limited, approximately one-third of patients may respond to a second antidepressant trial (see below)."	0
169782	"After two SSRIs have been ineffective, antidepressants from a different class (such as bupropion or venlafaxine) should be chosen."	0
169783	Adherence may be further enhanced by facilitating telephone access to the clinician for patient questions about side effects.	0
169784	"Outcomes and adherence can also be improved with the use of allied health professionals to proactively check on therapeutic response, side effects, and adherence, and to schedule return visits for patients with persistent symptoms."	1
169785	Antidepressant medication generally should be taken for a minimum of six to nine months after a first episode of depression.	0
169786	"The 2008 American College of Physicians guidelines recommend continued treatment for four to nine months after a satisfactory response for patients with a first episode of depression, and longer for patients with two or more episodes."	1
169787	"Patients should be informed that the medication leads to a genuine change in underlying neurochemistry, requiring several weeks to adjust to an initiation and discontinuation of medication."	0
169788	Frequent outpatient visits may increase the likelihood that patients will continue therapy for the necessary period of time.	0
169789	Premature discontinuation of antidepressant medication occurs commonly.	0
169790	A systematic review of six randomized trials comparing placebo and SSRI medications over a minimum of six months found a mean dropout rate of 48 percent after six to eight months.	0
169791	"In the STAR*D trial, slightly over one quarter of patients treated with citalopram as initial therapy for nonpsychotic major depression discontinued their medication for non-medical reasons within 14 weeks of initiation."	0
169792	"Factors associated with early attrition included younger age, less education, and higher perceived mental health."	0
169793	"When antidepressants are discontinued, it is common practice that medications should be tapered over two to four weeks to minimize symptoms associated with abrupt cessation of therapy."	0
169794	Discontinuation of antidepressants is discussed separately.	0
169795	"Patients who have depression in the setting of known precipitants such as psychosocial stresses, bereavement, or loss should continue drug therapy until a significant change in adaptation to those factors has been accomplished, and for a minimum of six months."	1
169796	"We find it helpful to use the analogy of a ""splint for a fracture."""	0
169797	"The psychosocial change is like the healing of a bone, and there is a need to keep the medication splint in place until the change is truly ""set.""."	0
169798	Relapse is relatively common once patients with major depression stop drug therapy.	1
169799	One study of 251 patients who were being treated by primary care physicians found that 37 percent reported a relapse within 12 months of stopping drug treatment.	1
169800	Risk factors for relapse were: Persistence of subthreshold depressive symptoms seven months after the initiation of antidepressant therapy (odds ratio 3.3).	0
169801	"History of two or more episodes of major depression, or chronic mood symptoms for two years (odds ratio 2.1)."	0
169802	A second prospective study followed 366 patients with depression (median follow-up 10 years) and found that 64 percent who initially recovered from major depression had a recurrence.	1
169803	"The risk for recurrence increased with each episode of depression, and recurrence was less likely as the time without recurrence lengthened."	0
169804	Maintenance antidepressant therapy can decrease the rate of relapse.	0
169805	A meta-analysis of 31 randomized trials (4410 patients) found a significantly higher risk of relapse in patients given placebo than in those maintained on antidepressants (41 versus 19 percent).	1
169806	The relative decrease in risk with maintenance of therapy appeared similar across all classes of antidepressants.	0
169807	Maintenance therapy also appears to be effective in elderly patients.	0
169808	"Based upon similar studies, the AHCPR Guideline Panel recommended maintenance therapy for patients with a history of three or more depressive episodes and for those with two previous episodes plus risk factors that would increase the risk of recurrence."	1
169809	Patients with double depression (dysthymia and major depression) should also be considered for maintenance treatment.	1
169810	Some of the medications used in augmentation therapy for resistant depression may also be appropriate for consideration earlier in therapy in specific patients.	0
169811	These patients are most appropriately treated by a psychiatrist who can collaborate with the primary care provider.	0
169812	"Adjunctive treatment with the second-generation antipsychotics aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone is efficacious for unipolar, nonpsychotic major depression that has not responded to antidepressant monotherapy."	0
169813	Augmentation of antidepressants with second-generation antipsychotics is discussed separately.	0
169814	"Patients with mood swings and a strong family history of bipolar disorder may meet criteria for bipolar II disorder, and should be treated with a mood stabilizing drug such as lithium, carbamazepine, valproate, or lamotrigine."	1
169815	"Lithium monotherapy may effectively treat acute unipolar depression, but there is far less evidence than there is for antidepressants."	0
169816	"We do not suggest using lithium as first-, second-, or third-line treatment for acute unipolar depression."	0
169817	Use of lithium to treat unipolar depression is discussed elsewhere.	0
169818	"Anxiolytics can be used as adjunctive treatment with an antidepressant, particularly for major depression that includes symptoms of anxiety (eg, ruminative thoughts, worrying, and panic attacks), insomnia, or psychomotor agitation."	0
169819	"The indications, general principles, and specific anxiolytic drug options are discussed separately."	0
169820	Treatment for anxiety disorders are discussed separately.	0
169821	The evidence for St.	0
169822	John's wort (hypericum extract) in the treatment of depression is discussed in detail separately.	0
169823	"In summary, European studies of well-defined standardized extracts of St."	0
169824	John's wort suggest that it is more effective than placebo and equivalent to tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs in the short-term treatment of depression.	0
169825	"However, studies in the US do not support its efficacy in the treatment of severe depression, and further research in mild depression is ongoing."	0
169826	"A systematic review notes the different findings depending on country of origin, but concludes that treatment with hypericum extract is effective."	0
169827	Patients with mild acute depression can be offered St.	1
169828	John's wort as an alternative to psychotherapy or conventional pharmacotherapy.	0
169829	"In the absence of more consistent evidence, we suggest that St."	0
169830	John's wort not be used in patients with significant major depression.	1
169831	We suggest avoiding concurrent use of St.	0
169832	John's wort and other antidepressants.	0
169833	"Concomitant use with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may lead to the ""serotonin syndrome,"" characterized by agitation, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and neuromuscular disturbances including rigidity."	0
169834	St.	0
169835	"John's wort also has potentially important drug interactions with a number of medications including HIV protease inhibitors, cyclosporine, and oral contraceptives."	0
169836	"Psychostimulants (dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, methylamphetamine, and pemoline) and a novel acting agent, modafinil, have been evaluated for both the initial treatment of depression as well as for use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of resistant depression."	0
169837	"A 2008 systematic review of short-term studies (four weeks) found that psychostimulating agents, compared to placebo, were somewhat effective for initial treatment of depression."	0
169838	"One study found no difference in symptoms, comparing with treatment with modafinil or placebo."	0
169839	The individual studies were small and there is question whether the difference in outcomes was clinically significant.	0
169840	Larger trials with longer follow-up are indicated before these medications can be recommended for initial depression treatment outside of a study setting.	0
169841	Oral supplementation with the adrenal androgen dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may be of some benefit in patients with depression.	1
169842	"In a six week crossover trial in 46 patients with major or minor depression who were not treated with an antidepressant medication, patients had significantly lower depression scores while receiving DHEA (30 mg three times daily for three weeks followed by 150 mg three times daily for three weeks) than at baseline or while receiving placebo."	1
169843	Androgenic side effects were not noted in this study.	0
169844	There is limited evidence on the safety or long-term effectiveness of DHEA and we do not currently recommend it for the treatment of depression.	0
169845	Acne and hirsutism have both been described in women participating in longer-term trials of DHEA.	1
169846	Other antiglucocorticoid treatments have also been evaluated for depression.	0
169847	"A meta-analysis of five trials in patients with non-psychotic depression found that treatment with one of several antiglucocorticoids (mifepristone, ketoconazole, metyrapone, or DHEA), was associated with a significantly greater response compared to placebo (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.91)."	1
169848	"The meta-analysis concluded that further investigation is indicated, given heterogeneity between studies."	0
169849	"Triiodothyronine (T3) has been used as augmentation therapy in patients with major depression who have not responded to initial treatment with antidepressant monotherapy, and has been combined with antidepressants at the onset of treatment to accelerate or enhance response."	1
169850	"Creatine may possibly be useful as short term, adjunctive treatment with antidepressants to treat unipolar major depression."	0
169851	An eight-week randomized trial compared creatine monohydrate (5 g per day) plus escitalopram (10 to 20 mg per day) with placebo plus escitalopram in 52 women with unipolar major depression (mostly first episode).	1
169852	Exclusion criteria included comorbid renal disease and serum creatinine levels that exceeded the normal range (>1.1 mg/dL).	0
169853	Remission occurred in more patients who received adjunctive creatine than placebo (52 versus 26 percent).	1
169854	"Adverse events were comparable for the two groups, and serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were within normal limits during the trial."	0
169855	"However, this single trial needs to be replicated before we can suggest using adjunctive creatine routinely."	0
169856	Potential drug interventions for depression under investigation include substance P and antagonists of corticotropin releasing factors and glucocorticoid receptors.	0
169857	"Initial studies often involve animal models of depression, largely based on stress-induced depression that may not adequately simulate depression in human subjects, which is also dependent on genetic and environmental factors."	0
169858	Data from the STAR*D trial indicate that outcomes for initial therapy of depression are the same when identical care is provided either in primary care or psychiatric specialty settings.	0
169859	Clinical indicators that suggest the need for psychiatrist and other mental health specialist referral include: First-line drug cannot be tolerated or produces no benefit.	0
169860	Signs of severe depression with possible thought disorder or suicidal ideation are present.	0
169861	"Comorbid medical, psychiatric, or substance abuse disorders are present."	0
169862	Patient wants to understand the depression and make significant behavioral and cognitive changes.	0
169863	The psychiatrist may be more easily accepted by patients as an expert in psychopharmacology and neurochemistry.	0
169864	Close collaboration between the psychiatrist and primary care provider can reduce patient fears about being separated from or dismissed by the primary care provider.	0
169865	"Collaborative care programs that involve enhanced patient education, integration of psychiatric visits into primary care treatment, and use of non-physician mental health professionals or depression care managers can significantly enhance depression outcomes compared with usual care."	0
169866	"A meta-analysis of 37 randomized controlled trials of collaborative care found effective programs were associated with three factors: improvement in medication adherence, use of a case manager with a mental health background, and regular case management supervision with a psychiatrist."	0
169867	The intensity of patient contact within a collaborative care system is likely another important component of effectiveness.	0
169868	"The frequent presence of comorbid medical conditions, and interactions between antidepressant and other medications, require continued communication between psychiatric and primary care providers."	0
169869	"Discrete descriptions of psychiatric symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment should be present in the medical record so that integration of care is possible."	0
169870	"Insurance companies in the US commonly require medical chart access to review for ""medical necessity"" for mental health treatment."	0
169871	"Medicare requires the presence of a treatment plan update that includes diagnosis, global assessment of function (GAF), treatment focus, length of treatment, type of medication, and nature of symptoms;"	0
169872	updates are required every three months.	0
169873	Some basic principles will allow respect of patient confidentiality: Make sure the patient is included within the sphere of communication.	0
169874	Patient permission is needed for written communication about their care;	0
169875	they should receive a copy of the communication.	0
169876	The medical record should be symptom-focused and treated as a working document shared by both patient and physician.	0
169877	"Minor depression is diagnosed when patients meet two to four symptom criteria, rather than the five or more necessary to diagnose major depression."	0
169878	The prevalence of minor depression in primary care settings is approximately twice that of major depression.	0
169879	"Despite the terminology, ""minor"" depression is associated with significant functional impairment, and up to 18 percent of these individuals will meet the criteria for major depression after one year of follow-up."	0
169880	"Only a few therapeutic studies have been conducted in patients with non-major depression, including the following: In one study of 415 elderly primary care patients with multiple comorbid illnesses and dysthymia or minor depression, 12 week treatment with paroxetine, but not problem solving therapy, resulted in greater improvement in symptoms than treatment with placebo."	1
169881	A subset analysis found that statistically significant improvement with paroxetine occurred only in patients with dysthymia or minor depression who had the highest degree of functional impairment.	1
169882	"A randomized trial in 162 patients with minor depression found that compared with placebo, patients treated with fluoxetine 20 mg daily for 12 weeks showed small but statistically significant improvements in severity scores for depression, and more patients were rated as ""not at all depressed"" (41 versus 24 percent)."	1
169883	There are also limited data on the efficacy of psychotherapy in patients with minor depression.	1
169884	A review of available studies found that problem-solving treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy were associated with short-term improvements in depressive symptoms in primary care patients with non-major depression.	1
169885	"We suggest treatment with antidepressants and psychotherapy for depressed patients with severe functional impairment, even if they do not meet the criteria for major depression."	1
169886	"Dysthymic patients can be treated with antidepressants or psychotherapy, taking into account patient preferences and the availability of therapists."	0
169887	"For other patients with minor depression, a four to eight-week trial of support, education, and exercise may suffice."	1
169888	"A trial of antidepressants or referral to a psychotherapist is warranted for patients who worsen, have persistent symptoms, or have increasing functional impairment while receiving supportive therapy."	1
169889	Dysthymic disorder is characterized by depressed mood and other depressive symptoms for at least two years;	0
169890	"however, symptoms are not as numerous as in major depression."	0
169891	Diagnosis of dysthymic disorder is discussed separately.	0
169892	Antidepressants are effective for dysthymic disorder.	0
169893	A meta-analysis of 9 randomized trials (1454 patients with dysthymic disorder) found that response (reduction of baseline depression rating scale score >=50 percent) occurred in significantly more patients who received an antidepressant than placebo (52 versus 30 percent).	1
169894	Psychotherapy does not appear to be useful for treating the symptoms of dysthymic disorder.	0
169895	"A review of randomized trials found little to no benefit for a variety of therapies, including dynamic therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and behavior therapy."	0
169896	The trials that have examined the use of interpersonal therapy in dysthymic disorder are discussed separately.	0
169897	Issues related to the treatment of depression in older adults are discussed separately.	0
169898	The decision how best to treat depression in pregnant women is complex and discussed in detail separately.	0
169899	"As with other drug use during pregnancy, the decision to treat depressed women with pharmacotherapy depends upon a balance of risks and benefits;"	1
169900	"there may be some adverse effects of drugs on the fetus, yet allowing a woman to suffer with symptomatic depression during pregnancy can also result in unacceptable costs to the woman and fetus."	0
169901	The balance of evidence suggests that mild to moderately depressed pregnant patients should be treated with psychotherapy.	0
169902	"Severely depressed pregnant patients and those not responding to psychotherapy should, in addition, receive pharmacotherapy."	1
169903	"Although several studies have demonstrated normal pregnancy outcomes with the use of tricyclic antidepressants or SSRIs, first trimester use of paroxetine has been associated with an increased risk of major congenital defects and carries a warning label cautioning use in pregnancy."	0
169904	Depression in patients with other medical illnesses is common and an important cause of morbidity.	1
169905	Depression in patients with chronic medical illness is associated with increased physical symptoms;	1
169906	functional impairment;	0
169907	"poor adherence to diet, exercise, and medications;"	0
169908	and increased medical costs.	0
169909	"Depression is also associated with worse outcomes of conditions including stroke, myocardial infarction, and diabetes."	0
169910	"Additionally, there is evidence that depression may increase the risk of developing such diseases."	0
169911	The diagnosis of depression in the physically ill is complex;	0
169912	symptoms such as a low mood and lack of energy may be due to the physical illness and/or to depression.	0
169913	Depression associated with specific medical conditions is discussed separately.	0
169914	Antidepressants appear to be effective and safe in patients with medical illness.	1
169915	"In a meta-analysis of 18 efficacy studies including 838 patients with a variety of physical diseases, antidepressant therapy resulted in greater improvement in depressive symptoms than either placebo or no therapy."	1
169916	"A subsequent meta-analysis of 25 randomized trials, which included 2338 patients with unipolar major depression and various comorbid general medical illnesses, found that response (50 percent or more reduction in baseline depression symptoms) occurred in more patients who received an antidepressant compared with placebo (risk ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.6)."	1
169917	Large trials have found that antidepressants were effective in patients with diabetes and with coronary artery disease.	1
169918	"Venlafaxine, bupropion, and duloxetine have been shown to reduce neuropathic pain in patients without depression, and would be preferred drug choices in depressed patients with chronic pain to both alleviate pain symptoms and treat the underlying depression."	1
169919	"In a randomized trial of 250 patients with concurrent depression and musculoskeletal pain, a stepped care approach of initial optimization of antidepressant treatment followed by a supervised pain self-management program over 12 weeks significantly improved severity scores for both depression and pain at 6 and 12 month follow-up, compared to usual care."	1
169920	"In this trial, venlafaxine was used in 61 percent of the intervention patients, an SSRI in 32 percent, and other antidepressants or combinations in the remainder."	1
169921	"While treatment of depression in patients with medical illness is effective in improving depression, it is unclear whether such treatment improves medical outcomes."	1
169922	"There have been conflicting results from clinical trials of treating depression in diabetes and after stroke, and treating depression after acute coronary syndromes has not been shown to improve mortality."	0
169923	Improvement in medical outcomes may depend upon the specific intervention that is used.	0
169924	"A single-blind, randomized trial, involving 214 patients with depression and poorly controlled diabetes, coronary heart disease, or both, compared treatment as usual with collaborative care, in which a medically supervised nurse provided guideline-based care for managing depression and the medical illness."	1
169925	"Those who received collaborative care had significantly greater improvement at 12 months of glycated hemoglobin levels, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and systolic blood-pressure levels, as well as depression symptoms."	0
169926	"For patients with chronic medical illnesses, exercise can reduce depressive symptoms."	1
169927	"A meta-analysis of 90 randomized trials examined the effects of exercise training on depressive symptoms (which did not meet criteria for a depressive disorder) in 10,534 patients with chronic medical illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, chronic pain and fibromyalgia, cancer, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."	1
169928	Exercise led to a statistically significant but clinically modest reduction of depressive symptoms.	0
169929	"However, in our clinical experience, many depressed patients with medical illnesses will not accept an exercise intervention due to fatigue, lack of motivation, or problems ambulating."	1
169930	A number of observational studies with methodologic flaws suggest that aerobic exercise is superior to no treatment for patients with major depression.	1
169931	"A meta-analysis of 25 randomized trials evaluating exercise, compared to standard treatment or no treatment, in patients with depression found that most trials did not analyze by intention to treat, and used inadequate randomization techniques."	1
169932	"A moderate but nonsignificant effect of exercise was seen when three higher quality studies were analyzed, although a large clinical effect was found when all studies were included."	0
169933	"One trial in older patients (age 50 and above) compared aerobic exercise (three supervised group aerobic exercise sessions per week), antidepressant therapy (sertraline), or combination therapy."	1
169934	"Patients who received antidepressant therapy alone had the fastest initial response, but there was no difference between groups at 16 weeks or 10 months."	1
169935	"The patients who volunteered for the study were motivated to exercise, highly educated, and relatively physically healthy, parameters that may be difficult to reproduce in the community setting."	1
169936	"The literature regarding the efficacy of light therapy is limited by design problems, including small sample sizes, inadequate blinding and placebo groups, and inconsistencies in the timing and dose of therapy."	0
169937	A meta-analysis of randomized trials found that bright light therapy in nonseasonal depression was associated with a significant reduction in depression symptom severity with effect sizes similar to those in pharmacotherapy trials.	0
169938	"However, given the limitations of the underlying studies, additional research is needed with larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up."	0
169939	"UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."""	0
169940	"The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition."	0
169941	"These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials."	1
169942	"Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed."	0
169943	These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.	1

169949	Major depression is a treatable illness that responds to a variety of therapeutic interventions.	0
169950	"Suicide is an uncommon complication of depression, but an assessment of suicide risk is critical in all depressed patients."	0
169951	The goal of treatment for depression should be remission of symptoms;	0
169952	partial response should result in incremental therapy.	0
169953	There are no clear predictors whether psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is best for individual patients with mild to moderate major depression.	1
169954	We recommend that patients with mild to moderate major depression begin either psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy as initial therapy.	1
169955	We recommend pharmacotherapy as initial therapy for patients with more severe depression.	1
169956	We recommend a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for patients with severe chronic (more than two years) or frequently recurrent depression.	1
169957	"The major classes of drugs used to treat depression are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), inhibitors of the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)."	0
169958	Clinical and quality of life outcomes provide no clear guidance on the choice between these agents.	0
169959	Patients who have been successfully treated with a well-tolerated drug in the past should resume that agent if depression recurs.	1
169960	"Other factors to be considered in drug selection include physician familiarity, cost, formulary preference, and side effects."	0
169961	"Due to their greater potential for serious adverse effects, we recommend that monoamine oxidase inhibitors be restricted to patients who do not respond to other treatments."	1
169962	Patients who require monoamine oxidase inhibitors are best managed by psychopharmacologists familiar with their use.	1
169963	Side effects of the antidepressants can be minimized by starting at low doses ).	0
169964	Therapeutic doses may need to be decreased in the elderly.	0
169965	Antidepressants are usually taken in the morning to avoid sleep disturbance.	0
169966	An initial therapeutic response typically occurs within two to six weeks of antidepressant therapy.	0
169967	We recommend that patients who have shown no response to antidepressant therapy by eight weeks be switched to another antidepressant.	1
169968	We suggest that patients who show no response to a second antidepressant be referred to a psychiatrist for further medication adjustment or augmentation.	1
169969	We suggest that patients who have a partial response to an antidepressant at eight weeks be given options of either augmentation (with bupropion or buspirone) or change to another antidepressant.	1
169970	Patients need to be evaluated at a minimum of every one to two weeks for six to eight weeks during the initiation phase of new pharmacologic treatment.	0
169971	This can be by office visit or telephone.	0
169972	We recommend that antidepressant medication be taken for at least six to nine months after a first episode of depression.	0
169973	"We suggest that when antidepressants are discontinued, they should be tapered over two to four weeks to minimize side effects associated with abrupt cessation of therapy."	0
169974	"We suggest that maintenance therapy (more than two years of treatment) be given to patients with a history of three or more depressive episodes, for those with dysthymia and major depression, and for those with two previous episodes plus risk factors that would increase the risk of recurrence."	1
169975	It may be reasonable to consider maintenance therapy for adults who have even one major recurrence.	1
169976	Anxious patients and those with difficulty sleeping can be offered a short acting benzodiazepine for no more than two weeks along with psychotherapy and/or antidepressant drug therapy.	1
169977	"Given the inconsistent evidence for efficacy, and the lack of regulated standardized products proven to be efficacious, we suggest not treating depression with St."	0
169978	John's wort . Patients with mild acute depression who nonetheless choose St.	1
169979	John's wort as an alternative to psychotherapy or conventional pharmacotherapy should be advised that the combination of St.	0

169981	"We suggest not advising exercise as a primary treatment for major depression, although exercise may be a useful adjunct as part of behavioral activation."	0
177784	"Odontogenic infections, consisting primarily of dental caries and periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis), are common and have local (eg, tooth loss) and, in some cases, systemic implications."	0
177785	"In the United States, it is estimated that 25 percent of adults over the age of 60 have lost all their teeth (edentulism), approximately one-half from periodontal disease and one-half from dental caries."	1
177786	"In addition to producing pain and discomfort, odontogenic infections can extend beyond natural barriers and result in potentially life-threatening complications, such as infections of the deep fascial spaces of the head and neck."	0
177787	Periodontal infection can also be associated with a number of systemic disorders.	0
177788	"These include fever of unknown origin, bacteremic seeding of heart valves and prosthetic devices, preterm birth of low birth weight children, and an increased risk for coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular events."	0
177789	"The complications, diagnosis, and treatment of odontogenic infections will be reviewed here."	0
177790	"The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of these infections are discussed separately."	0
177791	"Suppurative odontogenic infections may extend to potential fascial spaces in the orofacial area (orofacial space infections), or deep in the head and neck (peripharyngeal space infections)."	0
177792	The latter complication is often life-threatening.	0
177793	"In addition, odontogenic infections may spread contiguously to cause osteomyelitis of the jaw, or hematogenously to produce systemic illness."	0
177794	"Superficial orofacial space infections can involve the buccal, submental, masticator, canine, and infratemporal spaces."	0
177795	The location of the space infection can assist in recognizing the underlying infected tooth.	0
177796	"If unrecognized and untreated, these infections are potentially serious since they can spread contiguously into the deeper fascial spaces of the head and neck, such as the submandibular, lateral pharyngeal, and retropharyngeal spaces, or into the carotid sheath."	0
177797	The spread of infection into the deeper fascial spaces of the head and neck is suggested by the finding of trismus (the inability to open the jaw).	0
177798	Trismus indicates pressure or infection of the muscles of mastication (the masseter and the pterygoids) or involvement of the motor branch of the trigeminal nerve.	0
177799	"Such infections can spread intracranially to cause purulent meningitis or subdural empyema, and caudally to result in aspiration, airway obstruction, or fatal necrotizing mediastinitis."	0
177800	Infections arising from mandibular or maxillary bicuspid and molar teeth tend to extend in a lateral or buccal direction.	0
177801	The relation of the root apices to the origins of the buccinator muscle determines whether infection will exit intraorally into the buccal vestibule or extraorally into the buccal space.	0
177802	Infection of the buccal space is readily diagnosed because of marked cheek swelling with minimal trismus and systemic symptoms.	0
177803	Involvement of a mandibular incisor can perforate below the mentalis muscle and present as a submental space infection.	0
177804	The chin appears grossly swollen and is firm and erythematous.	0
177805	"Masticator spaces consist of the masseteric, pterygoid, and temporal spaces, all of which are well differentiated but intercommunicate with each other as well as with the buccal, submandibular, and lateral pharyngeal spaces."	0
177806	"Infection of the masticator spaces arises most frequently from molar teeth, particularly the third molars (wisdom teeth)."	0
177807	The clinical hallmark of masticator space infection is trismus and pain in the area of the body or ramus of the mandible.	0
177808	"Swelling may not be a prominent finding, especially in the masseteric compartment, since the infection is beneath large muscle masses that can obscure or prevent clinically apparent swelling."	0
177809	"When present, swelling tends to be brawny and indurated, suggesting the possibility of cervicofacial actinomycosis or mandibular osteomyelitis."	0
177810	Infection of the deep temporal space usually originates from involvement of the posterior maxillary molar teeth.	0
177811	Little external swelling is observed early in the course;	0
177812	"if present, it usually affects the preauricular region and an area over the zygomatic arch."	0
177813	"As infection progresses, the cheek, eyelids, and whole side of the face may be involved."	0
177814	"Infection may extend directly into the orbit via the inferior orbital fissure and produce proptosis, optic neuritis, and abducens nerve palsy."	0
177815	"Involvement of the maxillary incisors and canines may result in a canine space infection, which manifests as dramatic swelling of the upper lip, canine fossa, and frequently the periorbital tissues."	0
177816	"Pain is usually moderate, and systemic signs are minimal."	0
177817	"Occasionally, direct extension of infection into the adjoining antrum leads to purulent maxillary sinusitis."	0
177818	"The infratemporal space is bounded medially by the lateral plate of the pterygoid process and the pharynx, posteriorly by the parotid gland, anteriorly by the maxilla, and superiorly by the roof of the infratemporal fossa, adjacent to which is the inferior orbital fissure."	0
177819	"Primary infections of the infratemporal fossa usually originate from involvement of the posterior maxillary molar teeth, particularly the third molar."	0
177820	Injection of local anesthetic into this area for a dental restoration may predispose to infection.	0
177821	"Clinically, marked trismus and pain are present, but very little swelling is observed early in the course."	0
177822	"Late manifestations are similar to those of temporal space infections, including extension into the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure."	0
177823	"In addition, if the infection extends internally, it can involve an area close to the lateral pharyngeal wall, resulting in dysphagia."	0
177824	Odontogenic infections can spread contiguously to cause osteomyelitis of the jaw.	0
177825	"The mandible is much more susceptible to osteomyelitis than the maxilla, primarily because the cortical plates of the former are thin and vascular supply to the medullary tissues is relatively poor."	0
177826	"Despite this, osteomyelitis secondary to odontogenic infection is relatively uncommon."	0
177827	"When it does occur, there is usually a predisposing condition, such as compound fracture, irradiation, diabetes mellitus, or steroid therapy."	0
177828	"With initiation of infection, the intramedullary pressure markedly increases, further compromising blood supply and leading to bone necrosis."	0
177829	"Pus travels through the Haversian and perforating canals, accumulates beneath the periosteum, and elevates it from the cortex."	0
177830	"If pus continues to accumulate, the periosteum is eventually penetrated, and mucosal or cutaneous abscesses and fistulae can develop."	0
177831	"Areas at greatest risk of perforation in the mandible are the lingual aspect in the region of molar teeth, and anteriorly on the buccal aspect."	0
177832	"As the inflammatory process becomes more chronic, granulation tissue is formed."	0
177833	Spicules of necrotic and nonviable bone may become either totally isolated (sequestrum) or encased in a sheath of new bone (involucrum).	0
177834	Severe mandibular pain is a common symptom of jaw osteomyelitis and can be accompanied by anesthesia or hypoesthesia on the affected side.	0
177835	"In protracted cases, mandibular trismus may develop."	0
177836	A clinical variant of osteomyelitis of the jaw is Garre's chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis or proliferative periostitis.	0
177837	This entity usually occurs in children and young adults following a periapical infection of the mandibular first molar.	1
177838	"It is a nonsuppurative form of osteomyelitis characterized by a localized, hard, nontender swelling over the mandible."	0
177839	"On radiographic imaging, the newly formed periosteal bone appears as layers outside the cortex, giving a characteristic ""onion skin"" appearance."	0
177840	Actinomycosis and radiation necrosis are two common causes of this form of osteomyelitis of the jaw.	0
177841	"A related clinical entity, characterized by exposed necrotic bone in the maxillofacial region, is osteonecrosis of the jaw associated with long-term administration of bisphosphonates for the treatment of osteoporosis or cancer."	0
177842	This is discussed in detail separately.	0
177843	"In addition to contiguous spread, odontogenic infections can disseminate hematogenously to seed native or prosthetic heart valves, joints, or other devices."	0
177844	"Although bacteremia can occur following almost all types of dental manipulations, including flossing, scaling, even tooth brushing and chewing hard candy, such episodes are usually transient and inconsequential in healthy individuals."	0
177845	"In contrast, the bacteremia in patients with dental caries and periodontal disease tends to be more frequent and sustained, and is a potentially important cause of infective endocarditis in elderly patients, who may be more susceptible due to age-related degenerative or calcified valvular heart disease."	1
177846	Dental sources of bacteremia in elderly adults are of increasing concern for those undergoing prosthetic heart valve implantation or prosthetic joint replacement.	0
177847	"It has been recommended that routine dental assessment be performed in all patients undergoing valve surgery, and that appropriate therapeutic interventions be initiated whenever possible before valve implantation."	1
177848	Recommendations regarding the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis in selected patients are presented separately.	0
177849	The risk of prosthetic joint infection as a consequence of bacteremia following dental procedures has been controversial.	0
177850	This is also discussed in detail separately.	0
177851	An association between poor oral health and chronic periodontitis with coronary and cerebrovascular disease has been well established epidemiologically.	0
177852	The relevant data and possible mechanisms are discussed separately.	0
177853	Obtaining appropriate material for culture and processing it properly are important in the diagnosis of odontogenic infections.	0
177854	"In addition, imaging techniques to assess the extent of involvement are essential."	0
177855	One of the difficulties in defining etiologic agents for odontogenic infections is the presence of normal resident oral flora.	0
177856	"For closed space infections, it is imperative that the normal oral flora be excluded during specimen collection in order to interpret culture results."	0
177857	"Needle aspiration of loculated pus by an extraoral approach is desirable, and specimens should be transported immediately to the laboratory under anaerobic conditions."	0
177858	"However, contamination by the resident oral flora is inevitable for intraoral lesions."	0
177859	"In this setting, direct microscopic examination of stained smears often provides more useful information than culture results from surface swabs."	0
177860	Gram stain and acid fast stains for bacteria and potassium hydroxide preparations for fungi should be routinely performed on these specimens.	0
177861	Tissue biopsies should be routinely examined for histopathologic evidence of acute or chronic inflammation and infection.	0
177862	"Specific microbial agents, including certain bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections, can sometimes be detected by immunofluorescence or polymerase chain reaction."	0
177863	Patients with chronic osteomyelitis often have soft tissue swelling and draining fistulas.	1
177864	Aspirates from the adjacent soft tissue swelling may be valuable.	0
177865	"In contrast, cultures from sinus tracts can be misleading, since there is communication with the external environment."	0
177866	"Thus, microorganisms that are isolated could represent colonization of the sinus tract rather than the organism responsible for the infected bone."	0
177867	Bone biopsies for histopathology and culture are often required for definitive diagnosis.	0
177868	The choice of imaging technique varies with the clinical setting: A panoramic or periapical radiograph may reveal the extent of advanced periodontitis or the presence of periapical abscess.	0
177869	Computed tomography (CT) is particularly sensitive for osseous structures and remains the imaging modality of choice for assessment of most odontogenic infections.	0
177870	Dental amalgam used in fillings may cause metallic streaking artifact on CT and obscure the region of interest.	0
177871	This problem can be minimized with multidetector CT imaging.	0
177872	CT and particularly magnetic resonance (MR) have become the preferred imaging modalities for the localization of deep fascial space infections of the head and neck.	0
177873	"A lateral radiograph of the neck may demonstrate compression or deviation of the tracheal air column, or the presence of gas within necrotic soft tissues."	0
177874	"In retropharyngeal infections, lateral radiography of the cervical spine or CT scanning can help determine if the infection is in the retropharyngeal space or the prevertebral space."	0
177875	"The former suggests an odontogenic source, while the latter suggests involvement of the cervical spine."	0
177876	"Technetium bone scanning, used in combination with gallium or indium-labeled white blood cell scanning, is particularly useful for the diagnosis of acute or chronic osteomyelitis, and for the differentiation of infection or trauma from malignancy."	0
177877	"In acute osteomyelitis, both the bone scan and gallium scan are likely to be positive."	0
177878	"In chronic osteomyelitis, the technetium scans may or may not be positive, while gallium or indium-labeled scans are often negative."	0
177879	"Similarly, bone neoplasms can be associated with a positive technetium scan but negative gallium or indium scan."	0
177880	"Although the scintigraphic findings may be suggestive, only bone biopsy will definitively differentiate infection from malignancy."	0
177881	"Meticulous attention to oral hygiene is the most important strategy for effective control of supragingival and subgingival plaque that, in turn, is essential for both caries prevention and the treatment of periodontitis."	0
177882	Individuals with physical or mental limitations who cannot adequately perform oral hygiene by themselves should receive daily oral hygiene by care providers.	1
177883	More frequent visits to dentists and use of electric toothbrushes should also be considered in these patients.	0
177884	Regular check-ups and prompt restorative care by dental professionals should be actively promoted.	0
177885	"With the recognition of the microbial specificity of odontogenic infections, topical antiseptics and systemic antibiotics have played an increasingly important role in the control and treatment of both dental caries and periodontal disease."	0
177886	"The need for dental extractions has been reduced considerably by the availability of improved dental restorative materials, such as bonding and fluoride-releasing agents, as well as improved restorative care."	0
177887	"Caries management with restorative therapy (eg, fillings) is the preferred therapeutic approach in many countries."	0
177888	"However, restorative therapy must be combined with preventive measures, since restorations have relatively short durability and new caries may form at the margins of restorations if the causes of the disease persist."	0
177889	Caries prevention is discussed below.	0
177890	"Pulpitis, inflammation of the dental pulp, occurs when progression of dental caries exposes the dental pulp, leading to infection )."	0
177891	"The early and dominant symptom of acute pulpitis is a severe toothache that can be elicited by thermal changes, especially cold drinks."	0
177892	Pulpitis can be classified as reversible or irreversible.	0
177893	Reversible pulpitis occurs when caries encroach on the pulp and is associated with mild inflammation of the pulp.	0
177894	"Irreversible pulpitis refers to ongoing inflammation within the pulp chamber with rapid buildup of pressure, occlusion of blood vessels at the apical foramen, ischemia, and necrosis of the pulp tissue."	0
177895	"Irreversible pulpitis is characterized by acute and intense pain, and is one of the most frequent reasons that patients seek emergency dental care."	0
177896	"Apart from removal of the tooth, the customary approach to relieving the pain of irreversible pulpitis is by drilling into the tooth, removing the inflamed pulp (nerve), and cleaning the root canal."	0
177897	"A minority of dentists begins with a trial of antibiotics and analgesics, although there is no proof of benefit from this approach."	0
177898	A 2006 literature review found only one randomized controlled trial that compared treatment with systemic antibiotics to placebo in irreversible pulpitis.	0
177899	"In this study, 40 patients were treated with analgesics and randomly assigned to either penicillin or placebo."	0
177900	No operative endodontic treatment was performed.	0
177901	"Although the study was limited by small sample size, no significant difference in pain intensity or use of analgesics was noted between the two groups."	0
177902	"More recently, photo-activated disinfection has been evaluated as an aid to mechanical irrigation in eradicating bacterial counts within the root canal during endodontic treatment."	0
177903	It was highly effective in eliminating endodontic pathogens from the root canal.	0
177904	It remains to be determined whether this approach provides incremental benefit compared to conventional endodontic treatment in symptom relief or disease.	0
177905	Acute simple gingivitis rarely requires systemic antimicrobial therapy.	0
177906	Chlorhexidine 0.12 percent oral rinse can be used in most cases.	0
177907	"Exceptions include patients with rapidly advancing disease, severe pain, or HIV infection in whom systemic therapy is indicated."	1
177908	"Possible regimens include penicillin plus metronidazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, or clindamycin . Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, also known as Vincent's angina or trench mouth, should be treated with systemic antimicrobials, such as metronidazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, or clindamycin ."	0
177909	"Due to microbial specificity in various forms of periodontitis, certain types of severe periodontitis are amenable to systemic antimicrobials in conjunction with mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing)."	0
177910	This approach has often obviated the need for radical surgical resection of periodontal tissues.	0
177911	The efficacy of antimicrobial therapy was evaluated in a double-blind trial in which 94 patients with advanced periodontitis were randomly assigned to metronidazole (500 mg PO twice daily) or doxycycline (100 mg daily) or placebo for one or two weeks in conjunction with rigorous mechanical debridement of the root surfaces.	1
177912	Antimicrobial therapy reduced the need for radical surgery by 81 percent compared to placebo.	0
177913	The efficacy of local antibiotic therapy in conjunction with scaling and root planning in chronic periodontitis has also been evaluated.	0
177914	Adjunctive local antibiotics have been shown to significantly reduce pocket depth or degree of periodontal detachment.	0
177915	"Effective agents include 2 percent minocycline spheres (Arestub), 10 percent doxycycline hyclate extended release liquid (Atridox), and 25 percent metronidazole gel (Elyzol)."	0
177916	These agents release controlled amounts of the antibiotic beneath the gum and are used in conjunction with scaling and root planing to reduce pocket depth in adult periodontitis.	0
177917	"In localized juvenile periodontitis, systemic tetracycline therapy directed against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a HACEK infection) and combined with local periodontal treatment has yielded excellent results."	0
177918	"Unfortunately, the administration of tetracycline or doxycycline to children eight years of age or younger can cause staining of the permanent dentition and is not generally recommended."	1
177919	"Furthermore, tetracycline resistance among periodontal pathogens has been increasingly recognized."	0
177920	The routine use of systemic antimicrobials to prevent postoperative infections following oral and/or periodontal surgery in a healthy host remains controversial.	0
177921	"In the setting of third molar extractions, a single dose of intravenous penicillin was shown to significantly reduce the incidence of surgical site infection in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial (8.5 versus 0 percent)."	0
177922	The most important therapeutic modality for pyogenic odontogenic infections is surgical drainage and removal of necrotic tissue.	0
177923	Needle aspiration by the extraoral route can be particularly helpful both for microbiologic sampling and for evacuation of pus.	0
177924	"The need for definitive restoration or extraction of the infected tooth, the primary source of infection, is usually readily apparent."	0
177925	Deep periodontal scaling and endodontic treatments with root filling is required in most instances.	0
177926	Effective surgical management requires a thorough understanding of the most likely anatomic routes of spread.	0
177927	The neighboring potential fascial spaces should be carefully and systematically surveyed.	0
177928	The optimum timing for incision and drainage is equally important.	0
177929	Premature incision into an area of cellulitis in an ill-conceived search for pus can disrupt the normal physiologic barrier and cause extension of infection.	0
177930	Antibiotic therapy can halt the local spread of infection and prevent hematogenous dissemination.	0
177931	"Antimicrobial agents are generally indicated if fever and regional lymphadenopathy are present, or when infection has perforated the bony cortex and spread into surrounding soft tissue."	0
177932	"Severely immunocompromised patients are particularly at risk for spreading orofacial infections, and empiric broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy in these patients is warranted."	0
177933	"The choice of specific antibiotics for the treatment of odontogenic infections is based more upon knowledge of the indigenous organisms that colonize the teeth, gums, and mucous membranes, as well as specific cariogenic and periodontopathic pathogens associated with clinical disease, rather than upon the results of culture and susceptibility testing."	0
177934	"Beta-lactamase production among oral anaerobes, particularly pigmented Prevotella spp and Fusobacterium spp, is increasingly recognized, and treatment failure with penicillin alone has been well documented."	0
177935	"Thus, penicillin monotherapy is no longer recommended."	0
177936	"Ampicillin-sulbactam (3 g IV every six hours) provides extended coverage against oral anaerobes, including those that produce beta-lactamases, and is the treatment of choice."	0
177937	An alternative is penicillin G (2 to 4 million units IV every four to six hours) in combination with metronidazole (500 mg IV or orally every eight hours).	0
177938	"Although metronidazole is highly active against anaerobic gram-negative bacilli and spirochetes, it is only moderately active against anaerobic cocci and is not active against aerobes, including streptococci."	0
177939	"As a result, it should not be used as a single agent in odontogenic infections except in acute necrotizing gingivitis and advanced periodontitis."	0
177940	Penicillin-allergic patients should be treated with clindamycin (600 mg IV every eight hours).	0
177941	Erythromycin and tetracycline are not recommended because of increasing resistance among some strains of streptococci and their lack of optimal anaerobic activity.	0
177942	"In the compromised host, such as the patient with leukemia and severe neutropenia after chemotherapy, it is prudent to cover for facultative gram-negative bacilli (including Pseudomonas spp) as well, and agents with broad-spectrum activity against both aerobes and anaerobes are desirable."	1
177943	Appropriate regimens are described in the table.	0
177944	Treatment of osteomyelitis of the jaw is complicated by the presence of teeth and persistent exposure to the oral environment.	0
177945	"Antibiotic therapy needs to be prolonged, often for weeks to months."	0
177946	"Adjuvant therapy with hyperbaric oxygen, if available, may hasten the healing process, particularly when combined with surgery, but data supporting this are inconclusive."	0
177947	"Surgical management, including sequestrectomy, saucerization, decortication, and closed-wound suction irrigation, is occasionally necessary."	0
177948	"Rarely, in advanced cases, the entire segment of the infected jaw has to be resected."	0
177949	The single most cost-effective measure for reducing dental caries is fluoridation of public water supplies.	0
177950	"Fluoride forms a complex with the apatite crystals in dentin by replacing the hydroxyl group, thereby lending strength to the entire structure."	0
177951	Fluoride also promotes remineralization of carious lesions and exerts a bacteriostatic effect.	0
177952	"In addition to fluoridated water, brushing two to three times daily with a fluoridated toothpaste (1000 ppm of fluoride, usually as sodium fluoride 1.1 percent or stannous fluoride 0.4 percent) effectively delivers fluoride to the tooth-plaque surface."	0
177953	"In high-risk individuals, additional fluoride therapy in the form of fluoride varnishes (22,600 ppm fluoride as five percent sodium fluoride, professionally applied three or four times a year) has been effective in caries prevention."	0
177954	The key for the prevention and control of dental caries and advanced periodontitis is the active promotion of oral hygiene.	0
177955	The components of such a regimen include: Regular brushing with a fluoridated toothpaste and dental flossing after each meal.	0
177956	Dietary counseling to reduce the ingestion of sugar-rich foods or beverages.	0
177957	"Use of topical fluorides and oral antimicrobial rinses, such as chlorhexidine for high-risk patients."	0
177958	"Modification of risk factors, such as smoking cessation."	0
177959	Overcoming the reluctance for regular visits to dental professionals.	0
177960	"It is also important to dispel the common misconception by physicians and patients that progressive dental caries, gingival disease, and loss of teeth is an inevitable and irreversible part of aging."	0
177961	The current lack of motivation of both patients and healthcare providers for regular and rigorous preventative dental care must be reversed.	1
177962	A variety of other measures have been effective for caries prevention.	0
177963	"None of these measures is routinely applied in clinical practice, but they are useful in selected patients with rampant caries."	1
177964	"Xylitol gum, a nonfermentable five-carbon sugar, as a sugar substitute between meals."	0
177965	"Oral antimicrobial rinses with 0.12 percent chlorhexidine help to control dental plaque bacteria, but have no proven effect on dental caries."	0
177966	"In addition, chlorhexidine has a bitter taste, stains the enamel and tongue, and prolonged application can promote the emergence of resistant microorganisms."	0
177967	"Among topical antibiotics, only vancomycin has been shown to reduce dental caries with some degree of success in humans."	0
177968	"Vaccines based upon various immunogens derived from Streptococcus mutans, the principal bacterial agent associated with dental caries, have been explored."	0
177969	"However, the prospect for an effective and safe vaccine remains remote and unlikely to be available for clinical application in the near future."	0
177970	The need for and appropriate frequency of routine dental scaling and polishing in patients at low risk for periodontal disease is uncertain.	1
177971	Recommendations regarding the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent bacterial endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections in selected patients undergoing dental procedures are presented separately.	1
177972	"Odontogenic infections, consisting primarily of dental caries and periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis), are common and have local (eg, tooth loss) and, in some cases, systemic implications."	0
177973	"Suppurative odontogenic infections may extend to potential fascial spaces in the orofacial area (orofacial space infections), or deep in the head and neck (peripharyngeal space infections)."	0
177974	The latter complication is often life threatening.	0
177975	"Odontogenic infections can also result in osteomyelitis of the jaw or hematogenous dissemination, which may in turn cause endocarditis or prosthetic joint infections."	0
177976	"For closed space infections, it is imperative that the normal oral flora be excluded during specimen collection in order to interpret culture results."	0
177977	"Needle aspiration of loculated pus by an extraoral approach is desirable, and specimens should be transported immediately to the laboratory under anaerobic conditions."	0
177978	The choice of imaging technique varies with the clinical setting.	0
177979	Computed tomography (CT) is particularly sensitive for osseous structures and remains the imaging modality of choice for assessment of most odontogenic infections.	0
177980	"Meticulous attention to oral hygiene is the most important strategy for effective control of supragingival and subgingival plaque that, in turn, is essential for both caries prevention and the treatment of periodontitis."	0
177981	"Pulpitis, inflammation of the dental pulp, occurs when progression of dental caries exposes the dental pulp, leading to infection )."	0
177982	"The early and dominant symptom of acute pulpitis is a severe toothache that can be elicited by thermal changes, especially cold drinks."	0
177983	"Apart from removal of the tooth, the customary approach to relieving the pain of irreversible pulpitis is by drilling into the tooth, removing the inflamed pulp (nerve), and cleaning the root canal."	0
177984	Acute simple gingivitis rarely requires systemic antimicrobial therapy.	0
177985	Chlorhexidine 0.12 percent oral rinse can be used in most cases.	0
177986	"Exceptions include patients with rapidly advancing disease, severe pain, or HIV infection in whom systemic therapy is indicated."	1
177987	"Possible regimens include penicillin plus metronidazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, or clindamycin."	0
177988	"Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, also known as Vincent's angina or trench mouth, should be treated with systemic antimicrobials, such as metronidazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, or clindamycin."	0
177989	Certain types of severe periodontitis are amenable to systemic antimicrobials in conjunction with mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing).	0
177990	This approach has often obviated the need for radical surgical resection of periodontal tissues.	0
177991	"For chronic periodontitis, a topical antibiotic approach is used in conjunction with scaling and root planing.(See."	0
177992	The most important therapeutic modality for pyogenic odontogenic infections is surgical drainage and removal of necrotic tissue.	0
177993	Needle aspiration by the extraoral route can be particularly helpful both for microbiologic sampling and for evacuation of pus.	0
177994	"The need for definitive restoration or extraction of the infected tooth, the primary source of infection, is usually readily apparent."	0
177995	Deep periodontal scaling and endodontic treatments with root filling is required in most instances.	0
177996	"In patients with pyogenic odontogenic infections, in addition to surgical management, antimicrobial agents are generally indicated if fever and regional lymphadenopathy are present, or when infection has perforated the bony cortex and spread into surrounding soft tissue."	1
177997	"Ampicillin-sulbactam (3 g IV every six hours) provides extended coverage against oral anaerobes, including those that produce beta-lactamases, and is the treatment of choice in immunocompetent patients."	0
177998	An alternative is penicillin G (2 to 4 million units IV every four to six hours) in combination with metronidazole (500 mg IV or orally every eight hours).	0
177999	Penicillin-allergic patients should be treated with clindamycin (600 mg IV every eight hours).	0
178000	The single most cost-effective measure for reducing dental caries is fluoridation of public water supplies.	0
178001	"Other preventive measures include regular brushing with a fluoridated toothpaste, dental flossing, and reducing the ingestion of sugar-rich foods or beverages."	0
178002	Recommendations regarding the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent bacterial endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections in selected patients undergoing dental procedures are presented separately.	1
178003	Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a common and potentially fatal cause of acute respiratory distress.	0
178004	"The clinical syndrome is characterized by the development of dyspnea, generally associated with rapid accumulation of fluid within the lung's interstitial and alveolar spaces, which is the result of acutely elevated cardiac filling pressures (cardiogenic pulmonary edema)."	0
178005	ADHF can also present as elevated left ventricular filling pressures and dyspnea without pulmonary edema.	0
178006	"ADHF is most commonly due to left ventricular (LV) systolic or diastolic dysfunction, with or without additional cardiac pathology, such as coronary artery disease or valve abnormalities."	0
178007	"However, a variety of conditions or events can cause cardiogenic pulmonary edema due to an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the absence of heart disease, including primary fluid overload (eg, due to blood transfusion), severe hypertension, particularly renovascular hypertension, and severe renal disease."	0
178008	The components of therapy of ADHF in patients with and without acute myocardial infarction (MI) will be reviewed here.	1
178009	A table to assist with emergency management of ADHF is provided ).	0
178010	General considerations for treatment of ADHF and the pathophysiology and evaluation of patients with ADHF are presented separately.	1
178011	Treatment of ADHF and cardiogenic shock in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is discussed separately.	0
178012	"Management of right ventricular MI, which typically presents with hypotension and clear lungs, is also discussed separately."	0
178013	Patients presenting with acute dyspnea from ADHF should be rapidly assessed and stabilized.	1
178014	A table to assist with emergency management of ADHF is provided.	0
178015	"Stabilization measures include: Airway assessment to assure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, including continuous pulse oximetry."	0
178016	Vital signs assessment with attention to hypotension or hypertension.	0
178017	Continuous cardiac monitoring.	0
178018	Intravenous access.	0
178019	Seated posture.	0
178020	Diuretic therapy.	0
178021	Vasodilator therapy.	0
178022	Urine output monitoring (perhaps with urethral catheter placement).	0
178023	"Following airway and oxygenation assessment, initial stabilization includes the initiation of therapies aimed at the rapid correction of hemodynamic and intravascular volume abnormalities."	0
178024	The mainstay of therapy for these abnormalities in the acute setting is vasodilator and diuretic therapy.	0
178025	The aggressiveness of each depends on the patient's hemodynamic and volume status.	0
178026	"Patients with flash pulmonary edema due to hypertension, for instance, require aggressive vasodilatory therapy."	1
178027	Patients with normotension and volume overload best respond to a combination of diuretic therapy and vasodilators.	1
178028	"Patients with hypotension and intravascular overload cannot tolerate vasodilators, and may respond either to diuretics alone or in combination with inotropes."	1
178029	It is important to tailor the therapy to the individual patient.	0
178030	Supplemental oxygen therapy and assisted ventilation should be provided as needed.	0
178031	The 2009 focused update of the 2005 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend oxygen therapy to relieve symptoms related to hypoxemia.	0
178032	The 2010 HFSA guidelines note that routine administration of supplemental oxygen in the absence of hypoxia is NOT recommended.	0
178033	"For patients requiring supplemental oxygen, we suggest initial therapies in the following order: Non-rebreather face mask delivering high-flow percent oxygen."	0
178034	"If respiratory distress, respiratory acidosis, and/or hypoxia persist, we suggest noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) as the preferred initial modality of assisted ventilation as long as the patient does not have a contraindication."	0
178035	"This approach is supported by evidence from meta-analyses and randomized trials in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema indicating that NPPV decreases the need for intubation and improves respiratory parameters, such as dyspnea, hypercapnia, acidosis, and heart rate."	1
178036	NPPV may be particularly beneficial in patients with hypercapnia.	1
178037	These issues and conflicting data on a possible impact on mortality are discussed in detail separately.	0
178038	"Patients with respiratory failure who fail NPPV, or do not tolerate or have contraindications to NPPV ) should be intubated for conventional mechanical ventilation."	1
178039	"In such patients, positive end-expiratory pressure is often useful to improve oxygenation."	0
178040	"Once initial therapy has begun, oxygen supplementation can be titrated in order to keep the patient comfortable and arterial oxygen saturation above 90 percent."	0
178041	Patients with ADHF are usually volume overloaded.	1
178042	"Even in the less common situation in which cardiogenic pulmonary edema develops without significant volume overload (eg, with hypertensive emergency, acute aortic or mitral valvular insufficiency), fluid removal with intravenous diuretics can relieve symptoms and improve oxygenation."	0
178043	Limited clinical trial data have shown a mortality benefit from diuretic therapy in patients with chronic HF.	1
178044	"Although the safety and efficacy of diuretics to treat ADHF have not been established in randomized trials, extensive observational experience has demonstrated that they effectively relieve congestive symptoms."	0
178045	"Patients with ADHF and evidence of volume overload, regardless of etiology, should be treated with intravenous diuretics as part of their initial therapy."	1
178046	Rare exceptions include patients with severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock.	1
178047	"In such cases, the underlying cause for hemodynamic instability should be sought and the patient may require hemodynamic and mechanical ventilatory support."	0
178048	Patients with aortic stenosis with volume overload should be diuresed with caution.	1
178049	"As noted in the 2009 focused update of the 2005 ACC/AHA HF guidelines, patients admitted with significant fluid overload should receive diuretic therapy without delay in the emergency department or outpatient clinic as early intervention may produce better outcomes."	1
178050	Intravenous rather than oral administration is recommended because of greater and more consistent drug bioavailability.	0
178051	Common initial intravenous doses of loop diuretics in patients with normal renal function include the following: Furosemide - 40 mg intravenously.	1
178052	Bumetanide - 1 mg intravenously.	0
178053	Torsemide - 10 to 20 mg intravenously.	0
178054	Diuretic dosing should be individualized and titrated according to response and patient status.	0
178055	Patients who are treated with loop diuretics chronically are usually treated with a higher dose in the acute setting;	1
178056	"the intravenous dose should be equal to or greater than (eg, 2.5 times) their maintenance oral dose (eg, an intravenous furosemide dose of 40 to 100 mg for a patient who had been taking 40 mg orally per day)."	1
178057	"In the DOSE trial of intravenous furosemide in patients with ADHF, there was an almost significant trend toward greater improvement in patients' global assessment of symptoms in the high dose (2.5 times the patients' prior dose) group compared to the low dose (equal the prior dose) group as discussed below."	1
178058	Peak diuresis typically occurs 30 minutes after administration.	0
178059	Most patients will require additional diuresis through the course of their care.	0
178060	Diuretic administration two or more times per day may be necessary.	0
178061	No single intravenous dosing regimen (bolus versus continuous infusion; high dose versus lower dose) has been shown to be superior to others as illustrated by the following observations: A meta-analysis of seven trials with a total of 221 patients with ADHF suggested that continuous infusion of a loop diuretic slightly increased the urine output (by a mean of 271 mL/day) compared to intermittent bolus injections.	1
178062	Less tinnitus and hearing loss occurred with continuous infusion.	0
178063	"However, the studies were small and heterogeneous and the results were largely driven by the largest trial (107 patients) in which hypertonic saline was administered only to the patients receiving continuous infusion of diuretic."	1
178064	"The best data come from the DOSE trial, published after the meta-analysis."	0
178065	The trial randomly assigned 308 patients to receive furosemide administered intravenously via either a bolus every 12 hours or continuous infusion and at either a low dose (equivalent to the patient's previous oral dose) or a high dose (2.5 times the previous oral dose).	0
178066	The efficacy endpoint was the patients' global assessment of symptoms over the course of 72 hours and the safety endpoint was change in serum creatinine from baseline to 72 hours.	0
178067	Worsening renal function was defined as increase in the serum creatinine >0.3 mg/dL [>26.5 micromol/L] at any time during the 72 hours after randomization.	0
178068	The following findings were noted: There was no significant difference in efficacy or safety endpoints for bolus versus continuous infusion.	0
178069	Patients assigned to intravenous bolus therapy were more likely to require a dose increase at 48 hours;	1
178070	"as a result, the total dose of furosemide over 72 hours was higher in the bolus group compared with the continuous infusion group, a difference that was almost statistically different (592 versus 480 mg, p = 0.06)."	0
178071	"High-dose furosemide, compared with low-dose furosemide, produced greater net fluid loss, weight loss, and relief from dyspnea but also more frequent transient worsening of renal function (23 versus 14 percent)."	0
178072	There was an almost significant trend toward greater improvement in patients' global assessment of symptoms in the high-dose group (p = 0.06);	0
178073	the mean change in the serum creatinine was less than 0.1 mg/dL (9 micromol/L) in both groups.	0
178074	"In summary, the available data suggest that intravenous continuous infusion and bolus loop diuretic therapy have similar efficacy in patients with ADHF."	1
178075	"Later transition from intravenous to oral diuretics should be made with careful attention to HF status, supine and upright hypotension, renal function and electrolytes."	0
178076	"Volume status, evidence of congestion, daily weights, intake, and output should be continually reassessed."	0
178077	"Monitoring should also include watching for and guarding against side effects (including worsening renal function, electrolyte abnormalities (with associated arrhythmia risk), and symptomatic hypotension)."	0
178078	Diuretic therapy can also precipitate attacks of gout.	0
178079	"Serum potassium and magnesium levels should be monitored at least daily, and more frequent monitoring is indicated when diuresis is rapid."	0
178080	Severe muscle cramps may occur with overly rapid diuresis and should be treated with potassium repletion if indicated.	0
178081	"By reducing intravascular volume, diuresis will eventually lower central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures."	0
178082	"In addition, furosemide and possibly other loop diuretics also have an initial morphine-like effect in acute pulmonary edema, causing venodilation that can decrease pulmonary congestion prior to the onset of diuresis."	0
178083	This effect appears to be mediated by enhanced release of prostaglandins.	0
178084	Reductions in right and left heart filling pressures with diuresis are frequently associated with augmented forward stroke volume and cardiac output related to decreases in functional tricuspid and mitral regurgitation and reduction in right ventricular volume with relief of left ventricular compression and improved left ventricular distensibility.	0
178085	"However, during diuresis some patients experience symptomatic hypotension with decreasing cardiac output and systemic blood pressure due to a lag in reequilibration of intravascular volume via movement of fluid from the interstitial space."	0
178086	Patients with HF with preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF) or restrictive physiology may be more sensitive to diuresis-induced reductions in preload.	1
178087	Diuretics may enhance the hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy even when volume overload persists.	0
178088	Careful monitoring during diuresis is required to prevent adverse hemodynamic effects.	0
178089	The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine often rise during diuretic treatment of ADHF and careful monitoring is recommended.	0
178090	"In the absence of other causes for an elevated BUN, a disproportionate rise in BUN relative to serum creatinine (BUN/serum creatinine ratio >20:1) suggests a prerenal state with increased passive reabsorption of urea."	0
178091	"An initial rise in BUN may be accompanied by a stable serum creatinine, reflecting preserved glomerular filtration rate (GFR)."	0
178092	Further elevations in BUN along with a rise in serum creatinine are likely if diuresis is continued in such patients.	0
178093	"An otherwise unexplained rise in serum creatinine, which reflects a reduction in GFR, may be a marker of reduced perfusion to the kidney and other organs."	0
178094	Patients in whom this occurs before euvolemic status is achieved have a worse prognosis.	1
178095	"Nevertheless, fluid removal may still be required to treat signs and symptoms of congestion, particularly pulmonary edema."	0
178096	"On the other hand, a stable serum creatinine suggests that perfusion to the kidneys (and therefore to other organs) is being well maintained and that the diuresis can be continued if the patient is still edematous."	0
178097	Changes in cardiac output and the consequent changes in renal perfusion is not the only determinant of changes in GFR in patients with HF.	1
178098	"Among patients with an elevated central venous pressure, the associated increase in renal venous pressure can reduce the GFR, while lowering venous pressure with diuretics and other therapies might therefore increase the GFR."	1
178099	"Guidelines for management of patients with ADHF with elevated or rising BUN and/or serum creatinine include the following: Other potential causes of kidney injury (eg, use of nephrotoxic medications, urinary obstruction) should be evaluated and addressed."	1
178100	"Patients with severe symptoms or signs of congestion, particularly pulmonary edema, require continued fluid removal independent of changes in GFR."	1
178101	"In the presence of elevated central venous pressure, renal function may improve with diuresis."	0
178102	"If the BUN rises and the serum creatinine is stable or increases minimally, and the patient is still fluid overloaded, the diuresis can be continued to achieve the goal of eliminating clinical evidence of fluid retention with careful monitoring of renal function."	0
178103	"If increases in serum creatinine appear to reflect intravascular volume depletion, then reduction in or temporary discontinuation of diuretic and/or ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy should be considered."	0
178104	Adjunctive inotropic therapy may be required.	0
178105	"If substantial congestion persists and adequate diuresis cannot be achieved, then ultrafiltration or dialysis should be considered."	0
178106	Some patients with ADHF do not respond adequately to initial loop diuretic therapy.	1
178107	These patients should be re-evaluated for congestion.	0
178108	The approach to patients with refractory edema is discussed in detail elsewhere.	1
178109	Summarized briefly: Sodium intake should be restricted to a limit of <2 g daily.	0
178110	Water restriction is also warranted in patients with hyponatremia.	1
178111	Doubling the diuretic dose until diuresis ensues or the maximum recommended dose is reached.	0
178112	Addition of a second diuretic to potentiate the effects of the loop diuretic.	0
178113	The HFSA and ACC/AHA guidelines recommend oral metolazone or spironolactone or intravenous chlorothiazide as the second diuretic agent to add when diuretic response is inadequate.	0
178114	Chlorothiazide is the only thiazide diuretic that can be given intravenously (500 to 1000 mg/day).	0
178115	"However, the availability of this preparation may be limited."	0
178116	"An oral thiazide, such as hydrochlorothiazide (25 to 50 mg twice daily) or metolazone (which has the advantage of once daily dosing) is an alternative for acute therapy and can be given chronically."	0
178117	"Although it has been suggested that metolazone is the thiazide of choice in refractory patients with advanced renal failure (GFR below 20 mL/min), there is at present no convincing evidence that metolazone has unique efficacy among the thiazides when comparable doses are given."	1
178118	Addition of an aldosterone antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended in selected patients with systolic HF to improve survival.	1
178119	"In addition, the associated reduction in collecting tubule sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion can both enhance the diuresis and minimize the degree of potassium wasting."	0
178120	"Thus, if not already being given, it is reasonable to initiate aldosterone antagonist therapy prior to the addition of a thiazide diuretic in patients with a low or low-normal serum potassium on loop diuretic therapy alone."	1
178121	Aldosterone antagonist therapy should be continued following hospital discharge only in patients who can be carefully monitored for hyperkalemia.	1
178122	"When given for diuresis or potassium sparing effects, a higher dose (up to 100 mg daily) than the usual heart failure dose may be needed."	0
178123	"If these modalities are not sufficiently effective, ultrafiltration may be considered."	0
178124	"Dietary sodium restriction is an important component of therapy to restore euvolemia, and greater restriction may be feasible in hospital than in the outpatient setting."	0
178125	The Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) guidelines on acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) recommend a low-sodium diet (2 g daily) and consideration of stricter sodium restriction in patients with recurrent or refractory volume overload.	1
178126	Hyponatremia is common among HF patients and the degree of reduction in serum sodium parallels the severity of the heart failure.	0
178127	"As a result, a low serum sodium is an adverse prognostic indicator."	0
178128	"Most HF patients with hyponatremia have volume overload, rather than volume depletion."	1
178129	The HFSA guidelines recommend fluid restriction (<2 L/day) in HF patients with moderate hyponatremia (serum sodium <130 meq/L) and volume overload and suggest that fluid restriction should be considered to assist in treatment of fluid overload in other patients.	1
178130	"Stricter fluid restriction may be considered in patients with severe (serum sodium <125 meq/L) or worsening hyponatremia, although patient tolerance of strict fluid restriction may be limited."	1
178131	"In patients without hypotension with severely symptomatic fluid overload, vasodilators such as intravenous nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, or nesiritide can be beneficial when added to diuretics or in those who do not respond to diuretics alone."	1
178132	"Patients with systemic hypertension may require more aggressive vasodilator therapy (eg, up-titration of nitroglycerin) to assure more rapid reversal of dyspnea."	1
178133	The 2010 HFSA guidelines provide the following recommendations for use of vasodilators: Intravenous vasodilators (nitroglycerin or nitroprusside) and diuretics are recommended for rapid symptom relief in patients with acute pulmonary edema or severe hypertension.	1
178134	"In the absence of symptomatic hypotension, intravenous nitroglycerin, nitroprusside or nesiritide may be considered as an addition to diuretic therapy for rapid improvement of congestive symptoms in patients admitted with ADHF."	1
178135	Frequent blood pressure monitoring is recommended with vasodilator agents.	0
178136	Dosage of these agents should be decreased if symptomatic hypotension develops.	0
178137	"Once symptomatic hypotension is resolved, reintroduction and titration may be considered."	0
178138	"Intravenous nitroprusside, nitroglycerin or nesiritide may be considered in patients with ADHF and advanced HF who have persistent severe HF despite aggressive treatment with diuretics and standard oral therapies."	1
178139	Nitrates are the most commonly used vasodilators.	0
178140	"In patients without symptomatic hypotension, intravenous nitroglycerin added to diuretic therapy may contribute to rapid improvement in congestive symptoms."	1
178141	Nitroglycerin reduces LV filling pressure primarily via venodilation.	0
178142	At higher doses the drug variably lowers systemic afterload and increases stroke volume and cardiac output.	0
178143	The benefit of nitrate therapy was illustrated by a study in which 110 patients were randomly assigned to a combination of either high dose intravenous isosorbide dinitrate plus low dose intravenous furosemide or low dose isosorbide dinitrate plus high dose furosemide.	0
178144	"Patients receiving the high dose isosorbide dinitrate and low dose furosemide combination had a significantly lower combined risk of myocardial infarction, requirement for mechanical ventilation or death than those treated with the high dose diuretic and low dose isosorbide regimen."	1
178145	Tachyphylaxis can occur within hours with administration of high doses of nitroglycerin and the strategy of nitrate-free interval used to reduce tolerance during chronic therapy could result in adverse hemodynamic effects in patients with ADHF.	1
178146	Potential adverse effects of nitroglycerin include hypotension and headache.	0
178147	Nitrate administration is contraindicated after use of PDE-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil.	0
178148	"In patients with ADHF, we recommend intravenous rather than transdermal (ointment or patch) or oral nitrate administration for greater speed and reliability of delivery and ease of titration."	1
178149	An initial dose of 5 to 10 mcg/min of intravenous nitroglycerin is recommended with the dose increased in increments of 5 to 10 mcg/min every 3 to 5 minutes as required and tolerated (dose range 10 to 200 mcg/min).	0
178150	"Similar benefits have been described with high-dose intravenous isosorbide dinitrate, where available."	0
178151	"However, if hypotension occurs, the longer half-life of isosorbide dinitrate compared to intravenous nitroglycerin (four hours versus three to five minutes) is a major disadvantage."	0
178152	Nitroprusside is a potent vasodilator with balanced venous and arteriolar effects producing rapid reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and increase in cardiac output.	0
178153	"A need for pronounced afterload reduction is an indication for nitroprusside (initial dose 5 to 10 mcg/min, dose titrated up to every 5 minutes, dose range 5 to 400 mcg/min) as opposed to nitroglycerin."	0
178154	"Examples of such settings include hypertensive emergency, acute aortic regurgitation, acute mitral regurgitation, or acute ventricular septal rupture."	0
178155	The dose is generally titrated to maintain a systolic blood pressure >90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg.	0
178156	The major limitation to the use of nitroprusside is its metabolism to cyanide.	0
178157	"The accumulation of nitroprusside metabolites can lead to the development of cyanide, or rarely thiocyanate, toxicity which may be fatal."	0
178158	Doses above 400 mcg/min generally do not provide greater benefit and may increase the risk of thiocyanate toxicity.	0
178159	"Nitroprusside administration requires close and continuous blood pressure monitoring, and may cause reflex tachycardia."	0
178160	Another potential risk is rebound vasoconstriction upon discontinuation of nitroprusside.	0
178161	"Thus, the use of nitroprusside is limited to selected patients, usually for durations of less than 24 to 48 hours."	1
178162	"The largest randomized trial of nesiritide in patients with acute HF, ASCEND-HF, found that nesiritide increased rates of hypotension, did not alter rates of death or rehospitalization at 30 days, and showed a borderline significant trend toward reducing dyspnea."	1
178163	There was no change in risk of worsening renal function.	0
178164	"For most patients hospitalized with acute heart failure (HF), we recommend not treating with nesiritide."	1
178165	"In carefully selected patients with appropriate hemodynamics (without hypotension or cardiogenic shock) who remain symptomatic despite routine therapy, a trial of nesiritide may be helpful as an alternative to other vasodilator therapy (nitroglycerin or nitroprusside)."	1
178166	"Nesiritide has a longer effective half-life than nitroglycerin or nitroprusside, so side effects such as hypotension may persist longer.(See."	0
178167	"Nesiritide is typically given as an initial intravenous bolus of 2 mcg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.01 mcg/kg per minute, with subsequent dose adjustment as necessary."	0
178168	"Close monitoring of hemodynamics, urine output, and renal function are necessary for effective clinical use and safety."	0
178169	.	0
178170	"For patients with HF due to systolic dysfunction, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are a mainstay of chronic therapy."	1
178171	"Among patients with ADHF, the role of angiotensin inhibition depends upon whether the patient is already receiving such therapy."	1
178172	"For the majority of patients with systolic dysfunction who have been treated with chronic ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, maintenance oral therapy can be cautiously continued during an episode of ADHF in the absence of hemodynamic instability or contraindications."	1
178173	These medications should be decreased or discontinued in the following settings: Hypotension.	0
178174	Acute renal failure.	0
178175	Hyperkalemia.	0
178176	"With regard to hypotension, two additional points should be considered: Some patients with chronic HF and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction tolerate relatively low blood pressures (eg, systolic blood pressure 90 to 100 mmHg)."	1
178177	Such patients often tolerate chronic ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy and may tolerate these drugs in the acute setting as well.	0
178178	Patients with acute pulmonary edema may initially be hypertensive due to high catecholamine levels during the early period of distress.	1
178179	"With initial therapy, blood pressure may fall rapidly and patients may become relatively hypotensive, particularly if they are aggressively diuresed."	0
178180	"Thus, long-acting drugs, such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, should be administered with caution the first few hours of hospitalization."	0
178181	"Although some have advocated early use of ACE inhibitor in patients with acute decompensated heart failure, we do not recommend this approach."	1
178182	"There are limited data on the safety and efficacy of initiating new ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in the early phase of therapy of ADHF (ie, the first 12 to 24 hours)."	0
178183	Major concerns with early therapy include: Patients with ADHF may develop hypotension and/or worsening renal function during initial therapy.	1
178184	Determining the pathogenesis of such complications is more difficult if an ACE inhibitor or ARB has been given.	0
178185	Hypotension following administration of these agents may be prolonged given the long effective half-lives of these agents.	0
178186	"The intravenous ACE inhibitor enalaprilat may have deleterious effects in patients with an acute myocardial infarction, especially when complicated by HF or aggressive diuresis."	1
178187	"Thus, intravenous enalaprilat is contraindicated in acute myocardial infarction, and not generally recommended in other patients with acute heart failure, although potentially useful in certain situations."	1
178188	"Early initiation of oral ACE inhibitor therapy is also not recommended (except for those with acute infarction), and should be avoided in patients at high risk for hypotension (eg, low baseline blood pressure or hyponatremia, which is a marker for increased activation of the renin-angiotensin system and therefore increased dependence upon angiotensin II for blood pressure maintenance)."	1
178189	"In addition, the aggressive diuretic therapy typically given for acute pulmonary edema may increase sensitivity to ACE inhibition or angiotensin blockade, including risks of hypotension and renal dysfunction."	0
178190	"Once the patient is stable, chronic oral therapy with ACE inhibitor or ARB can be started."	0
178191	Initiation of these therapies known to improve outcomes is recommended in stable patients with systolic dysfunction prior to hospital discharge.	1
178192	The intravenous inotropic agents such as dobutamine and/or milrinone may be helpful in selected patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction and low output syndrome (diminished peripheral perfusion and end-organ dysfunction) for whom treatment may be limited by marginal systemic blood pressure or inadequate response to vasodilator and diuretic therapy.	1
178193	"As recommended in the 2009 ACC/AHA focused update, for patients with evidence of hypotension associated with hypoperfusion AND obvious evidence of elevated cardiac filling pressures (eg, elevated jugular venous pressure or elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressure), intravenous inotropic or vasopressor drugs are recommended to maintain systemic perfusion and preserve end-organ function while more definitive treatment is considered."	1
178194	"However, the usefulness of intravenous inotropic drugs to maintain systemic perfusion and preserve end-organ performance is uncertain for patients with severe systolic dysfunction, low blood pressure and evidence of low cardiac output."	1
178195	"Similarly, the 2010 HFSA guidelines for ADHF include the following recommendations for use of inotropes: Intravenous inotropes (milrinone or dobutamine) may be considered to relieve symptoms and improve end-organ function in patients with advanced HF characterized by LV dilation, reduced LVEF, and diminished peripheral perfusion or end-organ dysfunction (low output syndrome), particularly if these patients have marginal systolic blood pressure (<90 mmHg), have symptomatic hypotension despite adequate filling pressure, or are unresponsive to, or intolerant of, intravenous vasodilators."	1
178196	"Intravenous inotropes may be considered in similar patients (ie, patients with depressed systolic function and marginal cardiac output) with evidence of fluid overload if they respond poorly to intravenous diuretics or manifest diminished or worsening renal function."	1
178197	"When adjunctive therapy is needed in other patients with ADHF (eg, patients with preserved cardiac output), administration of vasodilators should be considered instead of intravenous inotropes."	1
178198	Intravenous inotropes are not recommended unless left heart filling pressures are known to be elevated or cardiac index is severely impaired based on direct measurement or clear clinical signs.	0
178199	Administration of intravenous inotropes (milrinone or dobutamine) in the setting of ADHF should be accompanied by continuous or frequent blood pressure monitoring and continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm.	0
178200	"If symptomatic hypotension or worsening tachyarrhythmias develop during administration of these agents, discontinuation or dose reduction should be considered."	0
178201	Inotropes are not indicated for treatment of ADHF in the setting of preserved systolic function.	0
178202	There is concern that inotropic agents may adversely impact outcomes in patients with ADHF with congestion without a low output state.	1
178203	"Inotropic agents may increase heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption and thus provoke ischemia and potentially damage hibernating but viable myocardium, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease."	1
178204	"In addition, inotropic agents can increase atrial and ventricular arrhythmias."	0
178205	"Given these concerns, careful patient selection is required for inotrope use."	0
178206	Routine use of inotropes in patients hospitalized for heart failure was found to be harmful in the OPTIME-CHF trial.	1
178207	"In this trial, 949 patients admitted to the hospital with an acute exacerbation of chronic HF were randomly assigned to a 48 to 72 hour infusion of milrinone or placebo."	1
178208	"Milrinone therapy was associated with significant increases in hypotension requiring intervention and atrial arrhythmias, and with nonsignificant increases in mortality in-hospital (3.8 versus 2.3 percent) and at 60 days (10.3 versus 8.9 percent)."	0
178209	"This trial did not evaluate patients whose treating physicians felt could not be randomized, but demonstrates overall adverse effects in noncritical patients despite improved symptoms."	1
178210	The general role of inotropic agents in patients with heart failure is discussed separately.	1
178211	The 2010 HFSA guidelines advised careful titration of either of the following inotropes when used in highly selected patients with ADHF: Milrinone - Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases myocardial inotropy by inhibiting degradation of cyclic AMP.	1
178212	Other direct effects of milrinone include reducing systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance (via inhibition of peripheral phosphodiesterase) and improving left ventricular diastolic compliance.	0
178213	These changes lead to an increase in cardiac index and decrease in left ventricular afterload and filling pressures.	0
178214	"Patients should receive a loading dose of 50 mcg/kg over 10 minutes, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.375 to a maximum of 0.750 mcg/kg per min."	0
178215	"Dose adjustment is required in the presence of renal insufficiency, hypotension, or arrhythmias."	0
178216	"Dobutamine - Dobutamine acts primarily on beta-1 adrenergic receptors, with minimal effects on beta-2 and alpha-1 receptors."	0
178217	"The hemodynamic effects of dobutamine include increase in stroke volume, and cardiac output, and modest decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure."	0
178218	The 2004 ACC/AHA STEMI guidelines suggest using dobutamine in patients with hypotension who do not have clinical evidence of shock.	1
178219	"It should be started at 2.5 mcg/kg per min and, if tolerated and needed, can be gradually increased to 15 mcg/kg per min."	0
178220	"Since milrinone does not act via beta receptors, its effects are not as diminished as those of dobutamine by concomitant beta blocker therapy."	0
178221	Use of dopamine is discussed separately.	0
178222	"Beta blockers reduce mortality when used in the long-term management of such patients, but must be used cautiously in patients with decompensated HF with systolic dysfunction because of the potential to worsen acute HF due to systolic dysfunction."	1
178223	"Thus, in patients with systolic dysfunction and ADHF, we approach the use of beta blockers in the following manner: For patients on chronic beta blocker therapy, if the degree of decompensation is mild without hypotension or evidence of hypoperfusion, continuation of beta blocker as tolerated is recommended."	1
178224	Support for continuation of beta blocker therapy in this setting comes from retrospective analyses of patients enrolled in randomized trials and reports from the OPTIMIZE-HF program and the Italian Survey on Acute Heart Failure.	1
178225	Withdrawal of beta blocker therapy was associated with increased mortality as compared to continuation of such therapy.	0
178226	"However, these retrospective analyses cannot definitively determine whether the discontinuation was the cause of the worse outcome."	0
178227	"While the increase in mortality was only partially explained by greater clinical risk factors in the patients withdrawn from beta blocker therapy, such analyses cannot account for all factors."	1
178228	"For more severely ill patients, halving of the dose of beta blockers or discontinuation may be necessary."	0
178229	"For patients on chronic beta blocker therapy with moderate-to-severe decompensation or hypotension, we decrease or withhold beta blocker therapy during the early phase of treatment."	1
178230	"In patients requiring inotropic support or those with severe volume overload, we withhold therapy."	0
178231	"For patients who are not treated with beta blocker therapy chronically, we do not initiate a beta blocker in the early management of acute HF."	1
178232	"However, a small randomized trial and a larger observational study found that initiation of therapy prior to hospital discharge in stable patients improves long-term beta blocker compliance without an increase in side effects or drug discontinuation, so initiation prior to discharge is recommended in stable patients."	0
178233	"Prior to initiation of therapy, the patient should have no or minimal evidence of fluid retention and should not have required recent intravenous inotropic therapy."	0
178234	Beta blocker therapy should start with low doses.	0
178235	Particular caution is indicated in patients who have required inotropes during their hospitalization.	1
178236	Randomized trials have demonstrated that aldosterone antagonist therapy (spironolactone or eplerenone) reduces mortality when included in long-term management of selected patients with systolic heart failure who can be carefully monitored for serum potassium and renal function.	1
178237	These include patients who have NYHA functional class II HF and an LVEF <=30 percent;	1
178238	or NYHA functional class III to IV HF and an LVEF <=35 percent;	0
178239	"and patients post ST elevation MI who are already receiving therapeutic doses of ACE inhibitor, have an LVEF <=40 percent, and have either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes mellitus."	1
178240	The serum potassium should be <5.0 meq/L and eGFR should be >=30 mL/min per 1.73 m2.	0
178241	"In patients already taking an aldosterone antagonist, such therapy can generally be continued during an episode of acute decompensation, with appropriate monitoring of blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes."	0
178242	"For patients not taking an aldosterone antagonist who have an indication for therapy, we favor initiation prior to discharge."	1
178243	"Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) with low-dose unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin, or fondaparinux is indicated in patients admitted with ADHF who are not already anticoagulated and have no contraindication to anticoagulation."	1
178244	"In patients admitted with ADHF who have a contraindication to anticoagulation, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with a mechanical device (eg, intermittent pneumatic compression device) is suggested."	1
178245	These issues are discussed in detail separately.	0
178246	Data are limited on the efficacy and safety of morphine therapy in ADHF.	0
178247	Morphine reduces patient anxiety and decreases the work of breathing.	1
178248	"These effects diminish central sympathetic outflow, leading to arteriolar and venous dilatation with a resultant fall in cardiac filling pressures."	0
178249	"However, retrospective studies have found that morphine administration for ADHF is associated with increased frequency of mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality, although a causal relationship has not been established."	0
178250	"In one retrospective analysis, morphine was administered in 14 percent of 150000 ADHF hospitalizations."	0
178251	"Morphine use was associated with more frequent mechanical ventilation, longer hospitalizations, more intensive care unit admissions, and greater mortality."	0
178252	"After risk adjustment and exclusion of ventilated patients, morphine remained an independent predictor of mortality (OR 4.8, 95% CI 4.52 to 5.18, p <0.001)."	0
178253	"Although risk adjustment in this study may not have been adequate, these results raise concern about the safety of morphine in this population."	0
178254	The 2008 ESC guidelines for the treatment of acute heart failure include consideration of morphine as an ungraded recommendation noting that supporting data are limited.	0
178255	Morphine therapy is not mentioned in the 2010 HFSA guidelines on management of ADHF or in the 2009 ACC/AHA focused update.	0
178256	"Given the limited evidence of benefits and potential risks of morphine, we suggest generally avoiding morphine therapy in the treatment of ADHF without acute MI."	0
178257	The role of morphine sulfate in patients with ADHF who have an acute MI is discussed separately.	1
178258	"In addition to the above treatments, several additional options and considerations may be relevant to selected patients."	0
178259	Management of refractory heart failure is discussed in detail separately.	0
178260	Patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema who are also in cardiogenic shock should be considered candidates for mechanical circulatory support.	1
178261	"These patients usually have a cardiac index less than 2.0 L/min per m2, a systolic arterial pressure below 90 mmHg, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure above 18 mmHg, despite adequate pharmacologic therapy."	0
178262	The two major mechanical modalities used in this setting are intraaortic balloon counterpulsation and an internally implanted left ventricular assist device.	0
178263	"Ultrafiltration is an effective method of fluid removal with advantages that include adjustable fluid removal volumes and rates, no effect on serum electrolytes, and decreased neurohormonal activity."	0
178264	Patients with ADHF accompanied by renal insufficiency or diuretic resistance may benefit from ultrafiltration.	1
178265	"Most studies have used a peripherally inserted ultrafiltration device that does not require central access, specialized nursing, or ICU admission."	0
178266	"The efficacy of ultrafiltration in patients with ADHF has been evaluated in several randomized trials: In the RAPID-CHF trial, 40 patients with ADHF and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >=1.5 mg/dL [133 micromol/L]) and/or anticipated diuretic resistance (high daily oral diuretic doses) were randomly assigned to receive usual care with or without ultrafiltration."	1
178267	Ultrafiltration was associated with significant increases in fluid removal after 24 hours (4650 versus 2838 mL without ultrafiltration) and weight loss (2.5 versus 1.9 kg) without a difference in serum creatinine.	0
178268	"In the larger UNLOAD trial, 200 patients hospitalized for ADHF were randomly assigned to ultrafiltration or to standard care including intravenous diuretics during the admission."	1
178269	Renal dysfunction and/or anticipated diuretic resistance were not entry criteria.	0
178270	"Thus, this study included a less selected group of HF patients."	1
178271	"The following findings were noted: At 48 hours, patients assigned to ultrafiltration had a significantly greater fluid loss (4.6 versus 3.3 liters with standard care)."	1
178272	This difference may in part reflect the relatively modest level of diuretic therapy used in the standard care arm.	0
178273	"At 90 days, patients assigned to ultrafiltration had significantly fewer HF rehospitalizations than patients assigned to standard care (0.22 versus 0.46 admissions per patient) and fewer unscheduled clinic visits (21 versus 44 percent with standard care)."	1
178274	"The rates of adverse events were similar in the two groups, although there was a higher incidence of bleeding in the standard care arm."	0
178275	"There was no difference in serum creatinine, as was also found in a smaller trial with detailed assessment of renal hemodynamics."	0
178276	"In CARRESS-HF, 188 patients with ADHF, worsened renal function (defined as an increase in the serum creatinine level of at least 0.3 mg/dL [26.5 micromol/L]), and persistent congestion were randomly assigned to either stepped pharmacology therapy or ultrafiltration."	0
178277	"The stepped pharmacologic care algorithm included bolus plus high doses of continuous infusion loop diuretic, the addition of metolazone, and selective use of inotrope or vasodilator therapy."	0
178278	The primary endpoint was the bivariate change in the serum creatinine level and body weight from baseline to 96 hours after enrollment.	0
178279	Ultrafiltration was inferior to pharmacologic therapy with respect to the primary end point due to increase in serum creatinine in the ultrafiltration group in contrast to a fall in mean serum creatinine in the pharmacologic therapy group (+0.23+-0.70 mg/dL [+20.3+-61.0 micromol/L] versus -0.04+-0.53 mg/dL [-3.5+-46.9 micromol/L]).	0
178280	There was no significant difference in weight loss at 96 hours between the ultrafiltration and pharmacologic therapy groups (5.7+-3.9 kg [12.6+-8.5 lb] and 5.5+-5.1 kg [12.1+-11.3] lb]).	0
178281	"A higher percentage of patients in the ultrafiltration group had serious adverse events (eg, heart failure, renal failure, anemia or thrombocytopenia, electrolyte disorder, hemorrhage, pneumonia, sepsis) (72 versus 57 percent)."	1
178282	"Thus, while ultrafiltration was an effective method for fluid volume removal, which provided similar amounts of weight loss to stepped pharmacologic therapy, it was inferior to stepped pharmacologic therapy for preservation of renal function at 96 hours and was associated with a higher rate of adverse events."	0
178283	Ultrafiltration is reserved for patients who do not achieve an adequate response to an aggressive diuretic regimen.	1
178284	"This recommendation is consistent with the 2005 (with 2009 update) ACC/AHA, 2008 ESC and 2010 HFSA heart failure guidelines."	0
178285	Consultation with a kidney specialist may be appropriate prior to opting for a mechanical strategy of fluid removal.	0
178286	"Vasopressin receptor antagonists have been investigated as an adjunct to diuretics and other standard therapies in patients with ADHF as a means of countering arterial vasoconstriction, hyponatremia, and water retention."	1
178287	"However, such treatment is controversial and not included in the HFSA guidelines."	0
178288	The 2008 ESC guidelines suggest consideration of tolvaptan for HF patients with hyponatremia in an ungraded recommendation.	1
178289	Tolvaptan is the most studied agent in this setting.	0
178290	"UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."""	0

178306	Mechanical cardiac assistance.	0
178307	Ultrafiltration.	0
178308	Patients with ADHF and a decreased oxygen saturation should be treated with supplemental oxygen.	1
178309	Patients with significant hypoxia or respiratory distress are generally treated with high flow oxygen via a nonrebreather facemask;	1
178310	later oxygen is titrated to patient comfort and an oxygen saturation of at least 90 percent.	0
178311	"For patients with ADHF and respiratory failure, we recommend a trial of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) if emergent intubation is not indicated, no contraindications to NPPV exist, and personnel with experience in NPPV are available."	1
178312	"Patients with respiratory failure due to ADHF who fail NPPV, do not tolerate NPPV, or have contraindications to NPPV ) require endotracheal intubation for conventional mechanical ventilation."	1
178313	Patients with ADHF and pulmonary edema have symptomatic relief and improved oxygenation with fluid removal.	1
178314	Diuretics are recommended except in patients with severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock.	1
178315	"In patients with ADHF and fluid overload, we recommend that initial therapy include an intravenous loop diuretic."	1
178316	Bolus dosing with intravenous loop diuretics achieves adequate diuresis in most patients.	0
178317	Determination of effective diuretic dosing should be confirmed by demonstration of a negative fluid balance.	0
178318	"For patients who do not have adequate fluid removal with this approach, options include: Continuous infusion of loop diuretic."	1
178319	Addition of a thiazide diuretic.	0
178320	Use of aldosterone antagonists is discussed below.	0
178321	Ultrafiltration is an option for patients refractory to diuretic therapy.	1
178322	"Vasodilators, including nesiritide, nitroglycerin, and nitroprusside, can reduce filling pressures, improve symptoms, and facilitate diuresis."	0
178323	"In patients with acute decompensated heart failure who are not hypotensive, we suggest the use of a vasodilator in addition to diuretic therapy with close hemodynamic monitoring."	1
178324	Intravenous nitroglycerin is generally recommended.	0
178325	Nitrate administration is contraindicated after use of PDE-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil.	0
178326	"In selected cases when there is a need for significant afterload reduction (eg, hypertensive emergency, acute aortic or mitral regurgitation), we recommend nitroprusside, although the risk of cyanide or thiocyanate toxicity limit its use."	0
178327	"For most patients hospitalized with acute heart failure (HF), we recommend not treating with nesiritide."	1
178328	"In carefully selected patients with appropriate hemodynamics (without hypotension or cardiogenic shock) who remain symptomatic despite routine therapy, a trial of nesiritide may be helpful as an alternative to other vasodilator therapy (nitroglycerin or nitroprusside)."	1
178329	"Nesiritide has a longer effective half-life than nitroglycerin or nitroprusside, so side effects such as hypotension may persist longer."	0
178330	"Patients with ADHF and systolic dysfunction who are hypotensive or who remain in pulmonary edema despite oxygen, diuresis, and, if tolerated, vasodilators, may benefit from intravenous inotropic support and may require mechanical cardiac support."	1
178331	"ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and beta blockers require special consideration in patients with decompensated heart failure."	1
178332	The approach to their use depends upon whether the patient has primarily systolic or diastolic dysfunction.	1
178333	"In patients with chronic HF due to systolic dysfunction the long-term use ACE inhibitors/ARBs and beta blockers reduces mortality, but there are short-term risks to the use of these medications in the setting of acute HF."	1
178334	"We approach the use of these medications in this setting in the following manner: For patients who are not already taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB, we suggest that they NOT be initiated at the time of presentation with an episode of ADHF."	1
178335	"An oral ACE inhibitor or ARB can usually be started within 24 to 48 hours, once the patient is hemodynamically stable."	0
178336	"For patients who are not already taking a beta blocker, we suggest that they NOT be initiated at the time of presentation with an episode of ADHF."	1
178337	"Beta blockers are generally started later than ACE inhibitors or ARBs, when the patient is euvolemic, usually shortly before discharge."	0

178339	"For patients who are already taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB, we suggest that maintenance of oral therapy be cautiously continued."	1
178340	"However, the dose should be decreased or the drug discontinued if hypotension, acute renal failure, or hyperkalemia is present."	0
178341	"For patients who are already taking a beta blocker, management depends upon the severity of HF decompensation and hemodynamic instability."	1
178342	"For patients with severe decompensation (eg, severe volume overload and/or requiring inotropic support), we suggest withholding beta blockers."	1
178343	"For patients with moderate-to-severe decompensation, we suggest decreasing or withholding beta blocker therapy."	1
178344	"For patients with mild decompensation without hypotension or evidence of hypoperfusion, we suggest continuation of beta blocker as tolerated."	1
178345	Aldosterone antagonist therapy (spironolactone or eplerenone) reduces mortality when included in long-term management of selected patients with systolic HF who can be carefully monitored for serum potassium and renal function.	1
178346	"In patients already taking an aldosterone antagonist, such therapy can generally be continued during an episode of acute decompensation, with appropriate monitoring of blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes."	0
178347	"For patients not taking an aldosterone antagonist who have an indication for therapy, we favor initiation prior to discharge."	1
178348	"As noted above, patients with ADHF are treated similarly whether they have primarily systolic or diastolic dysfunction."	1
178349	"However, in patients with diastolic dysfunction, long-term use of ACE inhibitors/ARBs and beta blockers does not provide the same benefit as in patients with HF due to systolic dysfunction."	1
178350	The efficacy of aldosterone antagonist therapy in this population is under investigation.	0
178351	"On the other hand, the short term risks of beta blockers are less concerning and treatment of hypertension and tachycardia are particularly important."	0
178352	"Thus, antihypertensive agents and beta blockers may be useful in acute as well as chronic HF in patients with primarily diastolic dysfunction."	1
178353	Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is indicated in patients hospitalized with ADHF.	1
178354	"There is limited evidence of benefit (eg, reduced patient anxiety and decreased worked of breathing) from morphine sulfate and there is potential risk (eg, increased need for ventilatory support), so we suggest avoiding morphine therapy in patients with ADHF without acute myocardial infarction."	0
178355	"Specific considerations apply to treatment of ADHF during acute MI, particularly the importance of revascularization."	0
182396	Heart failure (HF) is a common clinical syndrome representing the end-stage of a number of different cardiac diseases.	0
182397	It can result from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill with or eject blood.	0
182398	There are two mechanisms by which reduced cardiac output and HF occur: systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction.	0
182399	"An overview of the management of HF due to systolic dysfunction, including the treatment of associated conditions, will be presented here."	0
182400	"Drugs that should be avoided or used with caution in patients with HF, the management of refractory HF, and therapy of HF due to diastolic dysfunction are discussed separately."	1
182401	The following discussion will emphasize the therapeutic approach to the patient with chronic HF.	1
182402	The management of acute decompensated HF requiring hospitalization is presented separately.	0
182403	Such patients typically present with dyspnea and often have rales with or without peripheral edema.	0
182404	Several major societies have published extensive guidelines for the treatment of HF.	0
182405	"These include the 2005 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines with 2009 focused update, the 2006 Canadian Cardiovascular Society consensus conference, the 2008 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, and the 2010 Heart Failure Society of America guidelines."	0
182406	"With few exceptions, these societies make similar recommendations regarding the treatment of HF due to systolic dysfunction."	0
182407	Our approach is in broad agreement with these guidelines.	0
182408	The goals of HF therapy are clinical improvement followed by stabilization and ultimately a reduction in risk of morbidity (including the rate of hospitalization) and mortality.	0
182409	Management of HF begins with an accurate assessment of the etiology and severity of the disease.	0
182410	"This is followed by a therapeutic regimen aimed at the following factors: Correction of systemic factors (eg, thyroid dysfunction, infection, uncontrolled diabetes) ), as well as comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and sleep apnea."	0
182411	"Lifestyle modification - There have been no randomized trials to document the benefits of lifestyle modification, all of which are based upon observational studies and physiologic rationale."	0
182412	Cessation of smoking.	0
182413	Restriction of alcohol consumption.	0
182414	Salt restriction to approximately 2 to 3 g (or less) of sodium per day to minimize fluid accumulation.	0
182415	Weight reduction in obese subjects with goal of being within 10 percent of ideal body weight.	0
182416	Daily weight monitoring to detect fluid accumulation before it becomes symptomatic.	0
182417	"Review of drugs that may contribute to HF (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antiarrhythmic drugs, calcium channel blockers, thiazolidinediones)."	0
182418	Pneumococcal vaccination and annual influenza vaccination.	0
182419	Treatment of the cause of the heart disease.	0
182420	"Pharmacologic therapy to relieve symptoms (including the risk of hospitalization), slow the progression of the HF, and improve patient survival."	0
182421	Two types of devices are recommended in selected patients with HF: An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and for primary prevention in selected patients.	1
182422	The criteria for ICD implantation are discussed separately.	0
182423	"Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with biventricular pacing can improve symptoms and survival in selected patients who are in sinus rhythm and have a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and a prolonged QRS duration."	1
182424	Most patients who satisfy criteria for CRT implantation are also candidates for an ICD and receive a combined device.	1
182425	Criteria for CRT use are discussed separately.	0
182426	Specialized management for HF that is refractory to maximal oral pharmacologic therapy.)	0
182427	Cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support are discussed separately.	0
182428	"For hospitalized patients, comprehensive discharge support including close follow-up in the immediate postdischarge period may reduce the risk of rehospitalization."	0
182429	Underlying conditions that predispose to the development or exacerbation of HF should be identified and treated.	0
182430	Hypertension is the primary cause of HF in many patients.	0
182431	"In addition, hypertension imposes an increased hemodynamic load on the failing ventricle in patients with established HF."	1
182432	The goals of therapy are to reduce both preload (to diminish congestive symptoms) and afterload (to improve cardiac function).	0
182433	"A beta blocker, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and an aldosterone antagonist are the preferred antihypertensive agents because, as will be described below, they improve survival in patients with HF."	1
182434	Beta blockers can also provide anginal relief in patients with ischemic heart disease and rate control in those with atrial fibrillation.	1
182435	Beta blocker therapy should always be initiated at very low doses to minimize the risk of cardiac decompensation.	0
182436	"For patients who are still hypertensive after initiation of beta blockers and ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs, or who cannot tolerate these drugs, appropriate agents include loop diuretics, nitrates, hydralazine, and some vasoselective calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine and felodipine."	1
182437	"Another consideration in patients with HF and hypertension is renovascular disease, particularly in those with HF due to ischemic heart disease."	1
182438	"Recurrent unexplained heart failure decompensation and/or flash (sudden-onset) pulmonary edema occurs in some patients with renovascular hypertension, often with preserved (normal or near normal) left ventricular systolic function."	1
182439	"Flash pulmonary edema appears to be more common in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis as compared to those with unilateral disease (eg, 41 versus 12 percent)."	1
182440	The combination of bilateral renal artery stenosis and flash pulmonary edema has been named the Pickering syndrome.	0
182441	"Acute treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in patients with this syndrome includes blood pressure control and, in some cases, diuresis."	1
182442	"However, in patients who are euvolemic or dehydrated, diuresis should be avoided as it may lead to renal insufficiency, and preload reduction with nitrates is preferable."	1
182443	Only limited observational data are available on the efficacy of revascularization for this condition.	0
182444	"A review of revascularization (percutaneous, largely with stenting, or surgery) in 87 reported cases of bilateral renal artery stenosis and flash pulmonary edema reported that renal function improved in 81 percent and 92 percent had no further episodes of flash pulmonary edema."	0
182445	"However, these data must be viewed with caution given the limited controls and risk of bias in these case series."	0
182446	"The 2005 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) peripheral arterial disease guidelines recommended percutaneous revascularization for patients with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis and recurrent, unexplained heart failure or sudden unexplained pulmonary edema."	1
182447	"However, an AHA writing group later noted that treatment of atherosclerotic renal artery disease is controversial since the benefits and risks are not well-defined."	0
182448	"Coronary atherosclerosis is the most common cause of cardiomyopathy in the United States, comprising 50 to 75 percent of patients with HF."	1
182449	"In addition, coronary disease may be present in patients with HF of other causes, and may sometimes be overlooked as a contributing factor."	1
182450	Patients with ischemic heart disease may have HF from one or both of two mechanisms: a prior myocardial infarction (MI) followed by left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling;	1
182451	or hibernating myocardium due to chronic but potentially reversible ischemic dysfunction.	0
182452	A separate issue is that patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with a normal coronary arteriogram at diagnosis may over time develop significant coronary atherosclerosis.	1
182453	"All patients with documented ischemic heart disease should be treated medically for relief of angina and with risk factor reduction, such as rigorous control of serum lipids."	1
182454	"Myocardial revascularization with angioplasty or bypass surgery may improve symptom status, exercise capacity, and prognosis in selected patients with dysfunctional yet viable (hibernating or stunned) myocardium.)"	1
182455	Revascularization should also be considered in patients with a history of repeated episodes of acute left ventricular dysfunction and flash pulmonary edema.	1
182456	"Valvular heart disease is the primary cause of HF in perhaps 10 to 12 percent of patients In addition, valvular dysfunction is a secondary or superimposed phenomenon in many cases of HF."	0
182457	"As an example, some degree of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation is almost always present in patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy, regardless of etiology."	1
182458	"Valvular disease imposes a hemodynamic load on the ventricles, leading to further impairment in cardiac function, regardless of whether the valvular disease is primary or secondary."	0
182459	"Surgical correction of valvular disease, such as aortic or mitral stenosis or regurgitation or tricuspid regurgitation, can lead to improvement in cardiac function and resolution of symptoms."	0
182460	(See appropriate topics for the indications for surgery with various valvular lesions).	0
182461	"There are a variety of other potentially reversible conditions that can impair left ventricular function and cause, or worsen, HF."	0
182462	"These include alcohol abuse, cocaine abuse, obstructive sleep apnea, nutritional deficiencies, myocarditis, hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis, thyroid disease, and rheumatologic disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus."	0
182463	"The evaluation to detect these conditions should include a careful history, including a history of systemic or other noncardiac disease, and, in some cases, consideration of endomyocardial biopsy."	0
182464	"The goals of pharmacologic therapy are to improve symptoms (including risk of hospitalization), slow or reverse deterioration in myocardial function, and reduce mortality."	0
182465	"While the initial goal is to alleviate symptoms, drug therapy should be titrated as tolerated to target ranges for optimum clinical benefit."	0
182466	"The benefits observed from aggressive monitoring strategies (eg, brain natriuretic peptide guided therapy)) suggest that treatment beyond clinical congestion may improve outcomes."	0
182467	Additional pharmacologic therapy is directed at the prevention of arrhythmias and embolic events and the treatment of anemia and other possible exacerbating factors.	0
182468	"The treatment of HF in pregnancy involves specific concern about the effects of medications on the fetus and the mother, and therefore is discussed separately."	0
182469	"A number of drugs are recommended in HF for symptom relief and improvement in outcome  : Improvement in symptoms can be achieved by digoxin, diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)."	0
182470	"Prolongation of patient survival has been documented with diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, ARBs, hydralazine plus nitrate, and aldosterone antagonists."	0
182471	"A review of data from the PROVED and RADIANCE trials supported the use of combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor, digoxin, and diuretics for initial management."	0
182472	Subsequent studies showed that addition of beta blockers and spironolactone provides further benefit.	0
182473	We recommend the following approach to the long-term management of patients with HF.	1
182474	This approach is generally in agreement with the 2005 ACC/AHA task force guidelines for the treatment of HF  . The data supporting these summary recommendations are discussed in detail in the appropriate topic reviews.	0
182475	"Although the use of evidence-based HF therapies has improved due in part to national efforts such as the American Heart Association ""Get With the Guidelines"" program, the underutilization of evidence-based HF therapies continues to contribute to substantial excessive mortality."	0
182476	"We recommend the following sequence of drugs in the typical patient, with allowance for variations depending upon clinical response: Loop diuretics are introduced first for fluid control in patients in overt HF."	1
182477	"The goal is relief of signs or symptoms of volume overload, such as dyspnea and peripheral edema."	0
182478	"ACE inhibitors, or if not tolerated, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are typically initiated during or after the optimization of diuretic therapy."	0
182479	These drugs are usually started at low doses and then titrated to goals based upon trial data.	0
182480	"Beta blockers are initiated after the patient is stable on ACE inhibitors, again beginning at low doses with titration to trial goals as tolerated."	0
182481	"The following drugs should be given to selected patients in the absence of a contraindication: The addition of an aldosterone antagonist (spironolactone or, if not tolerated, eplerenone) to improve survival in patients who can be monitored for preserved renal function and a normal plasma potassium concentration and have NYHA functional class II HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <=30 percent;"	1
182482	or NYHA functional class III to IV HF and an LVEF <35 percent );	0
182483	"or are post-ST elevation myocardial infarction and already receiving therapeutic doses of ACE inhibitor, have an LVEF <=40 percent, and have either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes mellitus."	0
182484	Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) as an alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients who cannot tolerate these drugs.	1
182485	The addition of the combination of hydralazine and a nitrate for patients (particularly blacks) with a reduced LVEF who have persistent symptoms despite therapy with an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker.	1
182486	"Digoxin to reduce hospitalization for HF or, for patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation, for rate control."	1
182487	The administration of ACE inhibitors before beta blockers is largely based upon clinical trials with ACE inhibitors being performed before trials of beta blockers.	0
182488	"Subsequent randomized trials (eg, CIBIS III) suggest that the outcomes may be similar if beta blockers are given first."	0
182489	The approach we recommend is based upon the differences in time to benefit and the importance of attaining target dose between these two drug classes: ACE inhibitors provide rapid hemodynamic benefit and will not exacerbate heart failure in the short run.	0
182490	"The hemodynamic benefits of beta blockers are delayed (and there may be a transient worsening in cardiac function when therapy is initiated), but the long-term improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and survival are dose-dependent in patients who can tolerate the target dose."	1
182491	"However, patients who cannot tolerate the target dose may derive similar benefit as those who can, if they attain the same degree of beta blockade, as assessed from the reduction in heart rate."	1
182492	These observations suggest that some patients have higher sensitivity to beta blockers.	0
182493	"Given these considerations, we start with a low dose of an ACE inhibitor (eg, lisinopril 5 mg/day), increase to a moderate dose (eg, lisinopril 15 to 20 mg/day) at one to two week intervals, and then begin a beta blocker, gradually increasing toward the target dose or, if this cannot be achieved, the highest tolerated dose."	0
182494	"When the beta blocker titration is completed, the ACE inhibitor titration is completed."	0
182495	"In patients with low risk of adverse response to ACE inhibitors (good blood pressure, no hyponatremia, hyperkalemia or risk of intravascular depletion), higher doses of the ACE inhibitor can be started and the titration can be quicker."	1
182496	Complications that develop during dose titration should be treated.	0
182497	"For example, the diuretic dose should be increased for fluid overload."	0
182498	"Hypotension rarely limits metoprolol titration, but may occur with carvedilol due to its additional vasodilator activity."	0
182499	"If hypotension limits carvedilol titration, one should consider a change to metoprolol."	0
182500	"Since many patients with HF have low blood pressures, we generally alter the regimen only for symptoms or signs of underperfusion."	1
182501	A cardiologist should be consulted for patients who have difficulty attaining target doses.	1
182502	Sodium and water retention lead to the common congestive symptoms of pulmonary and peripheral edema.	0
182503	Fluid overload can typically be controlled and symptoms improved by diuretic therapy.	0
182504	Improvement in symptoms can occur within hours to days.	0
182505	"In comparison, the clinical effects of digoxin, ACE inhibitors, and beta blockers may require weeks or months to become fully apparent."	0
182506	"Although data on diuretic efficacy are limited, a meta-analysis of a few small trials found that diuretics were associated with reduction in mortality as well as reduced admission for worsening heart failure."	0
182507	"As stated in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF guidelines (last updated in 2009), the goal of diuretic therapy is to eliminate clinical evidence of fluid retention, such as elevated jugular venous pressure and peripheral edema [1]."	0
182508	This goal should be pursued while adverse effects are monitored.	0
182509	Appropriate diuretic usage can also affect the success of other drugs given for the treatment of HF.	0
182510	"Inappropriately low doses will result in fluid retention, which can diminish the response to ACE inhibitors and ARBs and increase the risk of decompensation with the use of beta blockers."	0
182511	"Conversely, excessive diuresis will lead to volume contraction, which can increase the risk of hypotension and renal insufficiency with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and beta blockers."	0
182512	"The most commonly used loop diuretic for the treatment of HF is furosemide, but some patients respond better to bumetanide or torsemide because of superior and more predictable absorption."	0
182513	The usual starting dose in outpatients with HF is 20 to 40 mg of furosemide or its equivalent.	1
182514	Subsequent dosing is determined by the diuretic response.	0
182515	"In patients who are volume overloaded, a reasonable goal is weight reduction of 1.0 kg/day."	1
182516	"If a patient does not respond, the diuretic dose should initially be increased to find the single effective dose, rather than giving the same dose twice a day."	0
182517	"Intravenous diuretics (either as a bolus or a continuous infusion) are more potent than their equivalent oral doses, and may be required for unstable or severe disease."	0
182518	Thiazide diuretics can be added for a synergistic effect.	0
182519	The fall in intracardiac filling pressure that results from diuretic-induced fluid removal may lower the cardiac output via the Frank-Starling relationship.	0
182520	This effect is usually minor and does not interfere with therapy.	0
182521	"However, an otherwise unexplained rise in BUN and serum creatinine should be viewed as a sign of a potentially important reduction in tissue perfusion."	0
182522	Further diuresis should be performed only with careful monitoring for signs and symptoms attributable to hypoperfusion.	0
182523	"Over the long term, diuretic therapy should be maintained to prevent recurrent edema."	0
182524	"In many cases, this adjustment can be facilitated by having the patient record his or her weight each day and allowing him or her to make changes in dose if the weight increases or decreases beyond a specified range."	0
182525	"ACE inhibitors improve survival in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF <=40 percent), ranging from asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction to moderate or severe HF."	1
182526	"Although some concern has been raised concerning their effectiveness in blacks, the available evidence is not sufficient to support a difference in ACE inhibitor use based on race."	0
182527	All patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction should be started on an ACE inhibitor.	1
182528	"Beginning therapy with low doses (eg, 2.5 mg of enalapril twice daily, 6.25 mg of captopril three times daily, or 5 mg of lisinopril once daily) will reduce the likelihood of hypotension and azotemia."	0
182529	"If initial therapy is tolerated, the dose is then gradually increased at one to two week intervals to, if tolerated, a target dose of 20 mg twice daily of enalapril, 50 mg three times daily of captopril, or up to 40 mg/day of lisinopril or quinapril."	0
182530	Blood should be obtained in all patients one to two weeks after starting or changing a dose and periodically thereafter to assess the plasma potassium concentration and renal function.	0
182531	These relatively high doses are recommended because they were used in the successful trials.	0
182532	"Although there is uncertainty if these doses are much more beneficial than lower doses, maximum dose therapy, if tolerated, is still recommended."	0
182533	"If the target doses cannot be administered or are poorly tolerated, lower doses should be used with the expectation that there are likely to be only small differences in efficacy between low and high doses."	0
182534	Some evidence suggests that aspirin inhibits the acute hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors.	0
182535	"However, most of the evidence does not support an inhibitory effect of aspirin on the long-term outcome benefits of ACE inhibitors in HF."	0
182536	"For patients with known coronary artery disease, ASA is still recommended."	1
182537	"However, there is no evidence for using aspirin in patients without coronary artery disease."	1
182538	"At least certain beta blockers, particularly carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, and bisoprolol, improve overall and event-free survival in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to III HF and probably in class IV HF."	1
182539	Beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (such as pindolol and acebutolol) should be avoided.	0
182540	The beta blocker trials in HF were carried out in patients receiving therapy with an ACE inhibitor;	1
182541	"thus, the improvement in survival is additive to that induced by ACE inhibitors."	0
182542	"The magnitude of benefit was illustrated in a meta-analysis that included 22 trials involving more than 10,000 patients."	0
182543	"Compared to placebo, beta blockers significantly reduced mortality at one year (odds ratio 0.65) and two years (odds ratio 0.72)."	0
182544	"During the first year, it was estimated that beta blocker therapy saved 3.8 lives per 100 patients treated and was associated with four fewer hospitalizations per 100 patients treated."	1
182545	"The controlled trials, which evaluated the role of beta blockers in HF, excluded patients with relative contraindications to beta blocker therapy."	1
182546	Relative contraindications in patients with HF include: Heart rate <60 bpm.	1
182547	Symptomatic hypotension.	0
182548	Greater than minimal evidence of fluid retention.	0
182549	Signs of peripheral hypoperfusion.	0
182550	PR interval >0.24 sec.	0
182551	Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block.	0
182552	History of asthma or reactive airways.	0
182553	Peripheral artery disease with resting limb ischemia.	0
182554	"We recommend use of carvedilol, bisoprolol or extended release metoprolol succinate since these beta blockers have been shown to reduce all-cause mortality and decrease hospitalization in patients with HF and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF <= 35 to 40 percent) in randomized controlled trials."	1
182555	Limited data are available on the comparative efficacy of these three beta blockers.	0
182556	Indirect evidence suggests that carvedilol may produce greater improvement in LVEF than metoprolol.	0
182557	Patients with low blood pressure may be less likely to tolerate carvedilol because of its vasodilatory activity.	1
182558	"Conversely, carvedilol may be preferred in patients with higher blood pressure."	1
182559	"Retrospective data suggest that some beta blockers other than those with proven benefit in randomized trials (eg, atenolol but not short-acting metoprolol tartrate) may be beneficial in HF."	0
182560	However these observations are not sufficient to support a recommendation for use of beta blockers without benefit established by randomized studies.	0
182561	Patients with low blood pressure may tolerate metoprolol better than carvedilol.	1
182562	"Conversely, those with high blood pressure may have a greater lowering of blood pressure with carvedilol."	0
182563	"In MERIT-HF, metoprolol succinate resulted in a higher blood pressure than placebo, presumably because of improved cardiac function."	0
182564	"The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend use of one of the beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (carvedilol, extended release metoprolol succinate, and bisoprolol) in all stable patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF, unless contraindicated  . The 2006 HFSA guidelines included a similar recommendation for patients with HF and LVEF <=40 percent."	1
182565	"In the absence of a contraindication, our recommendation is to offer carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol to patients with NYHA class II, III, or stable class IV HF with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40 percent."	1
182566	"Because of the need for careful attention to initial dosing and the risk of transient worsening of symptoms, it is recommended that beta blocker therapy be initiated under the consultative guidance of an experienced HF center."	0
182567	"Among inpatients, initiation of therapy prior to hospital discharge improves beta blocker use without an increase in side effects or drug discontinuation."	0
182568	"Prior to initiation of therapy, the patient should have no or minimal evidence of fluid retention and should not have required recent intravenous inotropic therapy."	0
182569	The patient should be informed that beta blockers may lead to an increase in symptoms for 4 to 10 weeks before any improvement is noted.	0
182570	Therapy should be begun at very low doses and the dose doubled every two weeks until the target dose is reached or symptoms become limiting.	0
182571	"Initial and target doses are: For carvedilol, 3.125 mg twice daily initially and 25 to 50 mg twice daily ultimately (the higher dose being used in subjects over 85 kg)."	0
182572	"For extended-release metoprolol (metoprolol succinate), 12.5 mg daily in patients with NYHA class III or IV or 25 mg daily in patients with NYHA II, and ultimately 200 mg/day."	1
182573	"If patients receive short acting metoprolol for cost reasons, dosing is not well established, but we recommend 6.25 mg twice daily initially and 50 to 100 mg twice daily ultimately."	0
182574	"For bisoprolol, 1.25 mg once daily initially and 5 to 10 mg once daily ultimately."	0
182575	Even lower starting doses should be given to patients with recent decompensation or a systolic pressure below 85 mmHg.	1
182576	Every effort should be made to achieve the target dose since the improvement appears to be dose-dependent.	0
182577	The proportion of patients who reach the target dose is higher in clinical trials than in the general population in which the patients are older and have more comorbid disease.	1
182578	"However, although not optimal, even low doses appear to be of benefit and should be used when higher doses are not tolerated."	0
182579	What may be most important is the degree of beta blockade.	0
182580	"However, aiming for a particular resting heart rate or a particular reduction in heart rate is not of proven value."	0
182581	The patient should weigh himself or herself daily and call the physician if there has been a 1 to 1.5 kg weight gain.	0
182582	"Weight gain alone may be treated with diuretics, but resistant edema or more severe decompensation may require dose reduction or cessation (possibly transient) of the beta blocker."	0
182583	"Although data about the duration of beta blocker therapy in HF are lacking, it has been suggested that patients who are doing well should not have the beta blocker withdrawn, since clinical deterioration and sudden death or death from progressive HF has been observed."	1
182584	"Spironolactone and eplerenone, which compete with aldosterone for the mineralocorticoid receptor, prolong survival in selected patients with HF as demonstrated in randomized controlled trials."	1
182585	The 2005 ACC/AHA heart failure guidelines with 2009 focused update recommended addition of an aldosterone antagonist in selected patients with moderate to severe HF and reduced LVEF who can be carefully monitored for preserved renal function and a normal plasma potassium concentration  . The subsequently published EMPHASIS-HF trial demonstrated benefit in selected patients with mild HF symptoms and reduced HF.	1
182586	"Thus, we recommend aldosterone antagonist therapy to treat HF in patients who have NYHA functional class II HF and an LVEF <=30 percent, or NYHA functional class III to IV HF and an LVEF <35 percent, who can be carefully monitored for serum potassium and renal function."	1
182587	"We also recommend aldosterone antagonist therapy for patients post ST elevation MI who are already receiving therapeutic doses of ACE inhibitor, have an LVEF <=40 percent, and have either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes mellitus, who can be carefully monitored for serum potassium and renal function."	1
182588	The serum potassium should be <5.0 mEq/L and eGFR should be >=30 mL/min per 1.73 m2.	0
182589	The endocrine side effects of spironolactone result from nonselective binding to androgen and progesterone receptors;	0
182590	eplerenone has greater specificity for the mineralocorticoid receptor and therefore has a lower incidence of endocrine side effects (1 versus 10 percent in clinical trials).	0
182591	"Although eplerenone is associated with fewer endocrine side effects than spironolactone (1 versus 10 percent in the respective trials), this advantage must be weighed against the marked difference in cost between the two drugs."	0
182592	"It may be reasonable to begin with spironolactone (25 to 50 mg/day), and switch to eplerenone (25 and after four weeks 50 mg/day) if endocrine side effects occur."	0
182593	"To the degree that blockade of a deleterious effect of aldosterone on the heart is important, a similar benefit would not be expected with other potassium-sparing diuretics (such as amiloride)."	0
182594	It is essential that serum potassium and creatinine be checked one to two weeks after starting spironolactone or eplerenone and periodically thereafter.	0
182595	Patients with poor renal function are particularly at risk for hyperkalemia.	1
182596	The following are risk factors for life-threatening hyperkalemia: Increasing age.	0

182605	Concomitant beta blocker use.	0
182606	Use of potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes.	0
182607	Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.	0
182608	"Renal dysfunction, which is an important risk factor for hyperkalemia in this setting, may be underestimated by the serum creatinine concentration, especially in elderly patients and other patients with reduced lean body mass in whom creatinine production is reduced."	0
182609	Formulas are available to estimate glomerular filtration rate from a stable serum creatinine that take into account age and body mass.	0
182610	ARBs for the treatment of HF appear to be as or possibly slightly less effective than ACE inhibitors when compared directly.	0
182611	"The CHARM-Alternative trial demonstrated benefit from candesartan in patients with NYHA class II or III HF who could not tolerate ACE inhibitors, primarily because of cough."	1
182612	"The 2005 ACC/AHA guidelines with 2009 update recommended an ARB in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors for this use and a class IIa recommendation for the use of an ARB as an alternative to ACE inhibitors, particularly in patients already taking an ARB for another indication."	1
182613	ARBs are more expensive than ACE inhibitors.	0
182614	"A separate issue, the value of adding an ARB to appropriate doses of an ACE inhibitor, was confirmed in the CHARM-Added trial for the composite outcome but not mortality."	0
182615	The 2005 ACC/AHA guidelines concluded that the weight of evidence was less well established and the 2008 European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommended the addition of an ARB in persistently symptomatic patients with a reduced LVEF who are already being treated with conventional therapy.	1
182616	"However, the subsequently published EMPHASIS-HF trial demonstrated the efficacy of adding aldosterone antagonist (to ACE inhibitor and beta blocker therapy) in patients with NYHA class II or III HF and reduced systolic function."	1
182617	"Thus, we recommend addition of an aldosterone antagonist (rather than an ARB) to ACE inhibitor and beta blocker therapy to treat HF in patients who can be carefully monitored for serum potassium and renal function who have NYHA functional class II HF and an LVEF <=30 percent;"	1

182621	"In patients who are appropriate candidates for ACE inhibitor plus aldosterone antagonist therapy, the addition of an ARB is not generally recommended."	1
182622	"Based upon the above considerations and the VALIANT trial, an ARB should NOT be added to an ACE inhibitor in the immediate post-MI setting."	0
182623	Hydralazine plus nitrate therapy may provide symptomatic and mortality benefit in selected patients with heart failure (HF) due to systolic dysfunction.	1
182624	Data supporting the efficacy of hydralazine plus nitrates in patients with HF due to systolic dysfunction are discussed separately.	1
182625	"In blacks, we recommend the addition of hydralazine plus oral nitrate therapy for patients with persistent NYHA class III to IV HF and LVEF <40 percent despite optimal therapy including a beta blocker, ACE inhibitor (or ARB), aldosterone antagonist (if indicated) and diuretics."	1
182626	"Although there is evidence of hemodynamic benefit in non-blacks as well as blacks, the strength of evidence of benefit of hydralazine plus nitrate therapy is stronger in blacks."	0
182627	"We suggest treatment with a combination of hydralazine plus nitrate in patients with HF and reduced LVEF who are unable to take both ACE inhibitor and ARB due to drug intolerance (including hyperkalemia), hypotension, or worsening renal insufficiency."	1
182628	ARB intolerance can be presumed in patients who develop hyperkalemia or renal insufficiency on ACE inhibitor therapy.	1
182629	Starting doses of hydralazine 25 mg three times daily and isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg three times daily are recommended.	0
182630	Uptitration of dose should be considered every two to four weeks.	0
182631	The dose should not be increased if symptomatic hypotension develops.	0
182632	The target dose is hydralazine 75 mg three times daily and isosorbide dinitrate (40 mg three times daily).	0
182633	"Although direct evidence of efficacy is lacking, isosorbide mononitrate (40 to 120 mg daily) may be used in place of isosorbide dinitrate to improve compliance."	0
182634	"Digoxin is given to patients with HF and systolic dysfunction to control symptoms (such as fatigue, dyspnea, and exercise intolerance) and, in patients with atrial fibrillation, to control the ventricular rate."	1
182635	"As demonstrated in the DIG trial, digoxin therapy was associated with a significant reduction in hospitalization for HF but no benefit in terms of overall mortality."	0
182636	"However, subsequent subgroup analyses suggest that digoxin may have an effect on survival that varies with the serum digoxin concentration (SDC)."	0
182637	"Compared to placebo, survival was significantly improved when the SDC was between 0.5 and 0.8 ng/mL in men and significantly worsened when the SDC was >=1.2 ng/mL."	0
182638	A similar relationship was seen in women with a nonsignificant trend toward improved survival when the SDC was between 0.5 and 0.9 ng/mL and significantly worse survival when the SDC was >=1.2 ng/mL.	1
182639	"The use of digoxin for the treatment of symptoms in patients with left ventricular dysfunction was considered reasonable in the 2005 ACC/AHA guidelines with 2009 update  . We suggest starting digoxin in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] <40 percent) who continue to have NYHA functional class II, III, and IV symptoms ) despite appropriate therapy including an ACE inhibitor, beta blocker, an aldosterone antagonist if indicated, and an additional diuretic if necessary for fluid control."	1
182640	"The usual daily dose of digoxin is 0.125 mg or less, based upon renal function."	0
182641	"Based upon the data from the DIG trial correlating serum digoxin concentration and survival, we recommend maintaining the SDC between 0.5 and 0.8 ng/mL."	0
182642	Digoxin is NOT indicated as primary therapy for the stabilization of patients with acutely decompensated HF.	1
182643	"Such patients should first receive appropriate treatment for HF, usually with intravenous medications."	0
182644	Digoxin may be initiated at the same time as part of a long-term treatment strategy to reduce risk of rehospitalization.	0
182645	Meta-analyses have defined the role of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers in women with HF.	1
182646	A meta-analysis of ACE inhibitor trials suggested that the benefit from these drugs may not apply to women.	0
182647	"Among trials of ACE inhibitor therapy in symptomatic HF, the relative mortality risk with an ACE inhibitor was significantly reduced in men at 0.80 (95% CI 0.68-0.93) but showed only a trend toward significance in women at 0.90 (95 0.78-1.05)."	1
182648	"Until more definitive data are provided, ACE inhibitors should continue to be used in women with HF."	1
182649	"In contrast, women appear to benefit from beta blockers to the same degree as men."	0
182650	"A pooled analysis from MERIT-HF, COPERNICUS, CIBIS II, and the United States Carvedilol Heart Failure trials found that the mortality benefit from beta blocker therapy was the same in men and women (relative risk 0.66 and 0.63, respectively)."	0
182651	"Race may affect the response to ACE inhibitors, hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate, and beta blockers in patients with HF."	1
182652	The V-HeFT trial and a matched cohort study from the SOLVD trial suggested that there were important differences between blacks and whites in the response to ACE inhibitors.	0
182653	Two major findings were noted: Blacks had higher rates of both progressive HF and overall mortality.	0
182654	"In the SOLVD analysis, the respective values were 13 versus 8 per 100 patient-years in whites for hospitalization for HF and 12 versus 10 per 100 patient-years for overall mortality."	1
182655	Blacks had a lesser response than whites to ACE inhibition with enalapril despite receiving similar doses.	0
182656	"In the SOLVD matched cohort study, enalapril therapy in whites was associated with a significant 44 percent reduction in hospitalization for HF compared to placebo;"	0
182657	"in contrast, there was no significant reduction among blacks."	0
182658	The apparent lack of response in blacks has some biologic plausibility since similar findings have been noted in patients with hypertension.	1
182659	Blacks respond less well to ACE inhibitors than to most other antihypertensive drugs.	0
182660	"In the matched cohort study from SOLVD, there were significant reductions in systolic and diastolic pressure with enalapril in whites (5/3.6) but not blacks."	0
182661	"In addition to genetic disparities, environmental differences (such as diet) could contribute to the varying response."	0
182662	"In contrast to these findings, another analysis of the SOLVD trials using mortality as the end point found that the relative risk (RR) of death was reduced to the same degree in both blacks and whites (RR for blacks 0.89, 95% CI 0.74-1.06; RR for whites 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.97)."	0
182663	"The risk reduction was significant in whites but not blacks, an observation that is likely to be explained by the smaller number of blacks in the trials (800 versus 5718)."	0
182664	"Thus, ACE inhibitors should continue to be used in black patients with HF."	1
182665	There are conflicting data on the efficacy of beta blockers in black patients.	0
182666	"In the carvedilol trials, the benefit of beta blockade was of similar magnitude in blacks and nonblack patients."	0
182667	"In comparison, it appeared that blacks derived no benefit with bucindolol in the BEST trial."	0
182668	"A meta-analysis of beta blocker trials in HF confirmed this distinction, finding different results depending upon whether or not the BEST data were included."	0
182669	"In the COPERNICUS, MERIT-HF, and United States Carvedilol Heart Failure trials, the reduction in all-cause mortality with beta blockers was the same for blacks and whites (relative risk 0.67 and 0.63, respectively)."	0
182670	"With inclusion of the data from BEST, the benefit of beta blockers remained significant for whites but was no longer significant in blacks (relative risk 0.69 and 0.97, respectively)."	0
182671	"These observations demonstrate that bucindolol, a beta blocker with partial beta agonist activity, is not effective in reducing mortality in blacks."	0
182672	"The reasons for this difference are not clear, but (as speculated by the authors of BEST) may include race-specific differences in the beta adrenergic pathway."	0
182673	"In the V-HeFT trials, blacks had a lesser benefit from ACE inhibition than whites, while the benefit of the hydralazine-nitrate combination was more pronounced."	0
182674	"This observation led to the design of the A-HeFT trial (African-American Heart Failure Trial), in which black patients with class III to IV HF on standard heart failure therapy (including an ACE inhibitor if tolerated) were randomly assigned to a fixed combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate or placebo."	1
182675	Diabetic patients with HF are treated in the same fashion as nondiabetics.	1
182676	Data supporting this approach are available for both beta blockers and ACE inhibitors.	0
182677	"The thiazolidinediones and metformin, which are often used in type 2 diabetics, are relatively contraindicated in patients with HF."	1
182678	Evidence from a randomized trial indicates that supplementation with N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in patients with HF can reduce mortality.	1
182679	The GISSI-HF investigators randomly assigned 6975 class II-IV chronic HF patients to 1 g/day n-3 PUFA or placebo with a median follow-up of 3.9 years.	0
182680	"Death from any cause was reduced with n-3 PUFA compared to placebo from 29 to 27 percent (adjusted hazard ratio 0.91, 95.5% CI 0.833-0.998) and the endpoint of death or admission to the hospital for cardiovascular reasons was also reduced (59 to 57 percent, adjusted hazard ratio 0.92, 99% CI 0.849-0.999)."	0
182681	The potential role of supplementation with N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for prevention of HF is discussed separately.	0
182682	Clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of statins on mortality in patients with both ischemic and nonischemic systolic HF.	1
182683	"Summarized briefly, no benefit from statin therapy has generally been demonstrated in patients with moderate to severe heart failure due to systolic dysfunction with or without coronary artery disease."	1
182684	Limited data suggest that statins may benefit patients with diastolic dysfunction.	1
182685	"Some initial studies suggested a possible deleterious effect of calcium channel blockers in patients with HF, while later trials with vasoselective calcium channel blockers amlodipine and felodipine showed a neutral effect on mortality."	1
182686	"Thus, there is NO direct role for these drugs in the management of HF."	0
182687	"However, amlodipine and felodipine appear to be safe in patients with HF and can be used if treatment with a calcium channel blocker is necessary for another indication, such as angina or hypertension."	1
182688	A variety of drugs should be avoided or used with caution in patients with HF.	1
182689	This issue is presented separately.	0
182690	Both chronic hypoperfusion and a reduction in physical activity lead to skeletal muscle dysfunction and exercise intolerance in patients with chronic HF.	1
182691	"Randomized controlled trials have shown that exercise training can lessen symptoms, increase exercise capacity, improve the quality of life, reduce hospitalization, and increase survival in patients with chronic HF."	1
182692	These improvements are additive to the benefits of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers.	0
182693	These issues are discussed in detail separately.	0
182694	The 2005 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend exercise training as an adjunctive approach to improve clinical status in patients with reduced LVEF and HF.	1
182695	"Based upon the available data, we recommend that cardiac rehabilitation be offered to patients with stable NYHA class II to III HF who do not have advanced arrhythmias and who do not have other limitations to exercise."	1
182696	Exercise training should be used in conjunction with drug therapy.	0
182697	"The beneficial effects of exercise are seen with high or low levels of training, and are apparent as early as three weeks after training."	0
182698	There are not enough data at present to recommend cardiac rehabilitation for patients with advanced HF.	1
182699	"Patients with HF should be evaluated serially to assess status, the response to therapy, and potential need for changes in management."	1
182700	"The 2005 ACC/AHA guidelines with 2009 update recommend that each visit should include assessment of ability to perform activities of daily living, volume status and weight, current use of alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs, alternative therapies, and chemotherapy drugs, as well as diet and sodium intake  . It was also considered reasonable to repeat measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction and structural remodeling in patients who have a change in clinical status, have experienced or recovered from a clinical event, or have received treatment that might significantly change these parameters."	1
182701	The efficacy of serial measurement of serum brain natriuretic peptide was considered less well established.	0
182702	"Although the majority of patients with HF due to systolic dysfunction respond to optimal medical therapy, some patients do not improve or experience rapid recurrence of symptoms."	1
182703	These patients have symptoms at rest or on minimal exertion and often require repeated prolonged hospitalizations for intensive management.	1
182704	"Specialized strategies are generally considered for these patients, including continuous intravenous positive inotropic therapy, cardiac resynchronization therapy, extracorporeal ultrafiltration via hemofiltration, mechanical circulatory support, surgery, or cardiac transplantation  ."	1
182705	"Because HF is a chronic disease which often leads to repeated hospitalization, and because many interventions (as described above) can influence morbidity and mortality, the expertise of those providing clinical care for a patient with HF may have a significant influence on outcomes."	1

182725	"Treatment of systolic HF is accomplished via appropriate combinations of the following agents: For patients with systolic HF and volume overload, we recommend diuretics."	1
182726	Such patients should also restrict dietary sodium.	0
182727	"For patients with HF with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF <=40 percent), we recommend ACE inhibitor therapy."	1
182728	"For patients with systolic HF who do not tolerate ACE inhibitors, we recommend an ARB as an alternative that provides a similar survival benefit."	1
182729	"For patients with current or prior HF and an LVEF <=40 percent, we recommend therapy with a beta blocker."	1
182730	"We believe that clinicians should choose one of the beta blockers of proven benefit (including reduction in all-cause mortality) in randomized trials (ie, carvedilol, extended-release metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol. For patients who can be monitored for preserved renal function and a normal plasma potassium concentration and meet one of the following criteria, we recommend the addition of an aldosterone antagonist (spironolactone or, if not tolerated, eplerenone): NYHA functional class II HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <=30 percent;"	1

182735	"For black patients with persistent moderate to severe HF symptoms and left ventricular ejection fraction <40 despite optimal therapy including a beta blocker, ACE inhibitor (or ARB), and aldosterone antagonist (if indicated) and other diuretics, we recommend the addition of the combination of hydralazine and an oral nitrate."	1

185679	The treatment of hypertension is the most common reason for office visits of non-pregnant adults to physicians in the United States and for use of prescription drugs.	1
185680	The national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) conducted from 2005 through 2008 estimated that approximately 29 to 31 percent of adults in the United States have hypertension.	1
185681	This translates into 58 to 65 million hypertensives in the adult population in the United States.	0
185682	"The number of patients with hypertension is likely to grow as the population ages, since either isolated systolic hypertension or combined systolic and diastolic hypertension occurs in the majority of persons older than 65 years."	1
185683	The rising incidence of obesity will also increase the number of hypertensive individuals.	0
185684	"Despite the prevalence of hypertension and its associated complications, control of the disease is far from adequate."	0
185685	"Data from the 2005-2008 NHANES survey show that only 46 to 51 percent of persons with hypertension have their blood pressure under control, defined as a level below 140/90 mmHg."	0
185686	"There are numerous potential reasons for low rates of blood pressure control, including poor access to health care and medications and lack of adherence with long-term therapy for a condition that is usually asymptomatic."	0
185687	The latter may be particularly true when the therapy may interfere with the patient's quality of life and when its immediate benefits may not be obvious to the patient.	0
185688	"Thus, hypertension will likely remain the most common risk factor for heart attack and stroke."	0

185697	These definitions apply to adults on no antihypertensive medications and who are not acutely ill.	1
185698	"If there is a disparity in category between the systolic and diastolic pressures, the higher value determines the severity of the hypertension."	0
185699	The systolic pressure is the greater predictor of risk in patients over the age of 50 to 60.	1
185700	Similar but not identical definitions were suggested in the 2007 European Societies of Hypertension and Cardiology guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension.	0
185701	"The major difference is that the European guidelines divide blood pressures below 140/90 mmHg into three categories (""optimal"", ""normal"", and ""high normal"") instead of the two categories (""normal"" and ""prehypertension"") defined by JNC 7."	0
185702	Clinical significance of blood pressure readings appears age dependant.	0
185703	"Over age 50 years, systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg predicts mortality regardless of diastolic readings."	0

185767	"Sequential studies have shown that the blood pressure drops by an average of 10 to 15 mmHg between visits one and three in patients who appear to have mild hypertension on a first visit to a new doctor, with a stable value not being achieved until more than six visits in some cases."	1
185768	"Thus, many patients considered to be hypertensive at the initial visit are in fact normotensive."	0
185769	"In addition to obtaining multiple blood pressure measurements, blood pressure should be measured in both arms and, in some individuals, postural measurements should be taken: Systolic blood pressure readings in the left and right arms should be roughly equivalent."	0

185771	"Postural hypotension, defined as a 20 mmHg or greater fall in systolic pressure upon rising from supine to an unassisted upright position, should be pursued in patients over age 65, those experiencing dizziness or weakness upon standing, or those with diabetes."	1
185772	"Approximately 20 to 25 percent of patients with stage 1 office hypertension have ""white-coat"" or isolated office hypertension in that their blood pressure is repeatedly normal when measured at home, at work, or by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring."	1
185773	"This problem is more common in the elderly, but is infrequent (less than 5 percent) in patients with office diastolic pressures >=105 mmHg."	1
185774	"One way to minimize the white coat effect is to have the blood pressure measured while seated after five minutes in a quiet, unobserved setting by an automated device that obtains five repeated blood pressure measurements at one to five minute intervals."	0
185775	"Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), which records the blood pressure at preset intervals (usually every 15 to 20 minutes during the day and every 30 to 60 minutes during sleep), can be used to confirm or exclude the presence of white coat hypertension in patients with persistent office hypertension but normal blood pressure readings out of the office."	1

185777	"24-hour monitoring of larger populations has revealed a significant number of patients with elevated out-of-office readings despite normal office readings (eg, masked hypertension)."	1
185778	Cardiovascular risk appears to be elevated in such patients to a similar extent as patients with sustained hypertension.	1
185779	This is consistent with the risk of hypertensive cardiovascular complications being more closely correlated with 24-hour or daytime ambulatory monitoring than with the office pressure.	0

185806	"In most clinical trials, antihypertensive therapy compared with placebo has been associated with significant 20 to 25 percent relative risk reductions in the incidence of heart failure and myocardial infarction, and a 30 to 40 percent reduction in the incidence of stroke."	0
185807	"However, these relative risk reductions do not tell the absolute benefit."	0
185808	"In the aggregate, antihypertensive therapy for four to five years prevented a coronary event in 0.7 percent of patients and a cerebrovascular event in 1.3 percent for a total benefit of approximately 2 percent;"	0
185809	this included a reduction in cardiovascular mortality of 0.8 percent.	0
185810	"Thus, 100 patients must be treated for four to five years to prevent a complication in two patients."	0
185811	It is presumed that these statistics underestimate the true benefit of treating stage 1 hypertension since the trials were of too short duration (five to seven years) to determine efficacy in a longer-term diseases such as atherosclerosis and heart failure.	0
185812	"Equal if not greater benefits have been shown with the treatment of elderly hypertensive patients (over age 65), most of whom have isolated systolic hypertension."	1
185813	"Because the elderly start at such higher overall cardiovascular risk, short-term reductions in their hypertension provide greater benefits than that observed in younger patients."	0
185814	"The benefits of antihypertensive therapy are less clear or controversial in patients who have mild hypertension (blood pressure less than 150/90 mmHg) and no preexisting cardiovascular disease, and in elderly patients who are frail."	1

185835	"In the absence of documented harm from moderate sodium reduction that is advocated in all expert guidelines, the proven ability of sodium reduction to lower blood pressure and to enhance the efficacy of all antihypertensive drugs, provides strong justification for the use of moderate sodium reduction."	0
185836	Weight loss - Weight loss in obese individuals can lead to a significant fall in blood pressure.	0
185837	"The decline in blood pressure induced by weight loss can occur in the absence of dietary sodium restriction, but even modest sodium restriction may produce an additive antihypertensive effect."	0
185838	The weight loss-induced decline in BP generally ranges from 0.5 to 2 mmHg for every 1 kg of weight lost.	0
185839	DASH diet - The DASH diet consists of increased intake of fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy products and can be combined with salt restriction.	0
185840	Exercise - Aerobic exercise usually has a beneficial effect on the systemic blood pressure.	0
185841	Limited alcohol intake - Women who consume two or more alcoholic beverages per day and men who have three or more drinks per day have a significantly increased incidence of hypertension compared to nondrinkers;	1
185842	this effect is dose-related and is most prominent when intake exceeds five drinks per day.	0
185843	"On the other hand, decreasing alcohol intake in individuals who drink excessively significantly lowers blood pressure, and moderate alcohol use appears to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease."	1
185844	Vitamin D - Vitamin D supplementation should be initiated in those with low or low-normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels or those at risk for vitamin D deficiency.	0
185845	Comprehensive intervention - The benefits of comprehensive lifestyle modification with all five of the above modalities were examined in the PREMIER trial.	0
185846	"At 18 months, there was a lower prevalence of hypertension (22 versus 32 percent), and less use of antihypertensive medications (10 to 14 versus 19 percent), although the difference was not statistically significant."	0
185847	Patient education - Patient education has been demonstrated to result in improved blood pressure control.	0
185848	"In addition to education of patients by their clinicians, blood pressure control may be improved when patients with hypertension hear the personal stories of their peers with hypertension."	1

185850	"Multiple guidelines and meta-analyses conclude that the amount of blood pressure reduction is the major determinant of reduction in cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertension, not the choice of antihypertensive drug."	1
185851	"Some patients have an indication for a specific drug or drugs that is unrelated to essential hypertension, which will influence the choice of therapy."	0
185852	"In the absence of a specific indication, there are three main classes of drugs that are used for initial monotherapy: thiazide diuretics, long-acting calcium channel blockers (most often a dihydropyridine such as amlodipine), and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers."	0

185920	"In addition, testing for microalbuminuria should be considered (always in patients with diabetes), and echocardiography can be performed in patients with borderline blood pressure values to help determine whether antihypertensive therapy should be initiated."	1
185921	An evaluation for identifiable or secondary causes of hypertension should be reserved for patients who have clinical clues to the presence of an underlying cause.	1
185922	All patients diagnosed with hypertension should undergo appropriate nonpharmacologic (lifestyle) modification.	1
185923	Antihypertensive medications should generally be begun if the systolic pressure is persistently >=140 mmHg and/or the diastolic pressure is persistently >=90 mmHg in the office and at home despite attempted nonpharmacologic therapy.	0
185924	Starting with two drugs may be considered in patients with a baseline blood pressure above 160/100 mmHg.	1
185925	"In a number of conditions (eg, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, post-myocardial infarction), certain antihypertensive drugs are given to improve survival or the underlying disease and other drugs are contraindicated, independent of the blood pressure )."	0
185926	"In the absence of a specific indication, there are three main classes of drugs that are used for initial monotherapy: thiazide diuretics, long-acting calcium channel blockers (most often a dihydropyridine), and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers."	0
185927	"It is the attained blood pressure, not the specific drug(s) used, which is the major determinant of outcome."	0
185928	The goal of antihypertensive therapy in patients with uncomplicated combined systolic and diastolic hypertension is a blood pressure of below 140/90 mmHg;	1
185929	treatment goals are determined by the higher blood pressure category.	0
185930	A number of clinical trials suggest possible benefit from a lower blood pressure goal in two settings: atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and proteinuric chronic kidney disease.	0
185931	"For the rapidly growing population of hypertensive individuals over age 65 with isolated systolic hypertension (eg, a diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg), caution is needed not to reduce the diastolic blood pressure to less 65 mmHg to attain a goal systolic pressure less than 140 mmHg, since such low diastolic pressures have been associated with an increased risk of stroke."	1
186156	"Systolic pressure generally rises with increasing age, while diastolic pressure reaches its peak in the fifth decade and subsequently falls."	0
186157	These features are a reflection of the slow decrease in the compliance of the large capacitance vessels.	0
186158	"The net effect is that the risk from hypertension varies in part with age: Among untreated patients less than 65 years old, there is a progressive increase in the risk of stroke and coronary disease with increasing blood pressure (BP)."	1
186159	The risk is greater for each increment in systolic pressure than for the equivalent increase in diastolic pressure.	0
186160	"For individuals over age 65, the risk continues to increase with the rising systolic pressure."	1
186161	"However, a reversal occurs with the diastolic pressure: the lower the diastolic pressure at a given systolic pressure, the greater the risk."	0
186162	"Thus, an increased pulse pressure is associated with an increased risk of an adverse event."	0
186163	The relative prognostic importance of the different blood pressure components in individuals of different ages was perhaps best studied among participants in the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II).	1
186164	"In this cohort study of 7830 participants between the ages of 30 to 74 years who were initially free of cardiovascular disease, the baseline blood pressure was correlated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality over a 15 year follow-up."	0
186165	"Over this period, 1588 patients died, with cardiovascular disease being responsible in 582 (37 percent)."	0
186166	"Unlike previous studies, the analysis was based upon a generalized additive risk model that utilized the correlation between systolic and diastolic blood pressures to estimate the risk for different baseline blood pressure combinations."	0
186167	"As a result, the risk associated with a blood pressure of 150/100 mmHg could be ascertained, whereas other studies permitted determination of the risk of a systolic pressure of 150 mmHg or a diastolic pressure of 100 mmHg, but not the combination."	0
186168	"In the latter studies, the risk attributed to a diastolic pressure of 100 mmHg was a composite of the range of systolic pressures associated with this diastolic pressure."	0
186169	"The following results were obtained concerning mortality beyond the first two years of follow-up: Among participants less than 65 years of age, increases in the systolic blood pressure were linearly related to increases in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality at all diastolic blood pressure levels."	1
186170	"By comparison, the correlation between diastolic blood pressure and mortality in this age group was ""hockey stick-shaped""."	0
186171	"This shape corresponds to a flat region of risk with diastolic values below 80 mmHg, with a marked increase in risk occurring with values above this level."	0
186172	"Among those greater than 65 years of age, increases in the systolic pressure were also linearly related to increased mortality at all diastolic pressures."	0
186173	"However, the risk with the diastolic pressure was J-shaped;"	0
186174	"thus, for a fixed systolic pressure, increasing diastolic pressure that was below approximately 80 to 90 mmHg was associated with a decreased risk of mortality, while increasing diastolic pressure above 80 to 90 mmHg was associated with an enhanced risk."	0
186175	"Increased pulse pressure was associated with marked variations in risk of mortality, depending upon age, and the exact systolic and diastolic pressure."	0
186176	An increasing number of trials have provided evidence that antihypertensive therapy that results in adequate blood pressure control provides some degree of cardiovascular protection.	0
186177	"However, the optimal level of control is unclear and may vary with certain patient populations."	0
186178	"In general, the benefits of increasingly intensive therapy must be weighed against the potentially increased incidence of serious side effects associated with such a regimen."	0
186179	The rationale for specific goal blood pressure levels in the general hypertensive population and the possible risks of excessive blood pressure lowering will be reviewed here.	0
186180	"The indications for antihypertensive therapy in mild hypertension, the choice of antihypertensive drugs for the initial treatment of hypertension, and goal blood pressure in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease are presented separately."	1
186181	Systolic and diastolic hypertension in the general population are defined as a blood pressure >=140/>=90 mmHg measured on at least three separate occasions.	0
186182	Randomized controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefit in patients with systolic and diastolic hypertension that was most pronounced in severe and moderate disease.	1
186183	"Although the number of patients was small in the severe and moderate hypertension trials, the magnitude of benefit was extremely high."	0
186184	"The best data on the treatment of severe diastolic hypertension come from a trial of 143 men with diastolic pressures of 115 to 129 mmHg (average clinic blood pressure 186/121 mmHg) who were randomly assigned to antihypertensive therapy or placebo, the incidence of cardiovascular events was 3 percent at 21 months in the treated group versus 39 percent at 16 months in the placebo group (p<0.001)."	1
186185	The shorter follow-up in the placebo group was due to the high number of terminating events.	0
186186	The average blood pressure during the trial was significantly lower in the treated group (143/91 mmHg versus no significant change in the placebo).	0
186187	"The efficacy of treating moderate diastolic hypertension was demonstrated in a trial of 210 men with diastolic pressures of 105 to 114 mmHg who were randomly assigned to antihypertensive drugs or placebo, the incidence of cardiovascular events at five years was significantly lower in the treated group (8 versus 32 percent)."	1
186188	The absolute benefit of blood pressure lowering is much lower in patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressures of 90 to 104 mmHg).	1
186189	A summary of the results from 17 controlled trials of mild to moderate diastolic hypertension (almost all also had systolic hypertension) in adults under age 65 found that active treatment with antihypertensive medications (which produced a mean reduction in diastolic pressure of 5 to 6 mmHg) led to a statistically significant 16 percent reduction in the number of coronary events and a 40 percent reduction in stroke.	1
186190	"In the aggregate, antihypertensive therapy for four to five years prevented a coronary event in 0.7 percent of patients and a cerebrovascular event in 1.3 percent for a total absolute benefit of approximately 2 percent;"	0
186191	this included an absolute reduction in cardiovascular mortality of 0.8 percent.	0
186192	There are no randomized trials that have evaluated the efficacy of treating mild hypertension in patients with baseline systolic pressures of 140 to 149 mmHg.	1
186193	"The three largest randomized trials that have been performed - the Medical Research Council (MRC) trial, the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP), and the FEVER trial - included patients with mean baseline systolic pressures of 150 to 160 mmHg."	1
186194	"All showed significant benefit from antihypertensive therapy, which lowered the mean blood pressure to less than 140 mmHg systolic and/or less than 90 mmHg diastolic."	0
186195	"MRC trial - In the MRC trial, 17,354 patients with a baseline diastolic pressure 90 to 109 mmHg were randomly assigned to bendrofluazide, propranolol, or placebo."	1
186196	The mean baseline blood pressure was approximately 161/98 mmHg;	0
186197	the mean attained blood pressure was approximately 137/86 in the two treated groups and 150/92 in the placebo group.	0
186198	The treated groups had significantly lower rates of all cardiovascular events (6.7 versus 8.2 per 1000 patient years) and of stroke but not of coronary events or mortality.	0
186199	"HDFP trial - In stratum I of the HDFP trial, 7825 patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg) were randomly assigned to intensive therapy in special clinics (stepped care) or to usual source of care therapy in the community."	1
186200	"The main end point was total mortality at five years, which was significantly lower with stepped care (5.9 versus 7.4 percent, absolute benefit 1.5 percent, 95% CI 0.4-2.6 percent)."	0
186201	"The magnitude of benefit was similar but not quite significant for the almost 3000 patients with an entry diastolic pressure of 90 to 94 mmHg (absolute benefit 1.6 percent, 95% CI -0.2 to +3.4 percent)."	1
186202	The average attained diastolic pressure was 85 and 90 mmHg in the stepped care;	0
186203	systolic pressures were not given.	0
186204	FEVER trial - The Felodipine Event Reduction (FEVER) trial included 9800 patients with previously treated hypertension who were switched from previous antihypertensive therapy to hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 12.5 mg/day.	1
186205	"At six weeks after switching, the patients were randomly assigned to felodipine or placebo;"	0
186206	the baseline blood pressure was 154/91 mmHg.	0
186207	"Add-on therapy had to be given to 34 and 42 percent of patients, respectively."	1
186208	"At a mean follow-up of 40 months, the average blood pressure was lower in the felodipine group (137/83 versus 143/85 mmHg with placebo)."	0
186209	The primary endpoint of fatal and nonfatal stroke occurred in significantly fewer patients in the felodipine group (3.7 versus 5.2 percent);	1
186210	all-cause mortality was also reduced (2.3 versus 3.1 percent).	0
186211	"In the general hypertensive population of adults <80 years of age (ie, not including patients at increased risk), we agree with major societies that recommend a goal blood pressure of <140/<90 mmHg."	1
186212	"However, supportive data for such a goal in patients with grade or stage 1 hypertension (systolic 140-159 mmHg and/or diastolic 90-99 mmHg) are limited."	1
186213	"Most trials, except for stratum I in HDFP, included patients whose blood pressure at baseline was higher than these values."	1
186214	"In the aggregate, the above findings from the MRC, HDFP stratum I, and FEVER trials support the recommended goal blood pressure of <140/<90 mmHg in the general hypertensive population."	0
186215	The goal blood pressure may be lower in patients at increased cardiovascular risk due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes mellitus or in patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease.	1
186216	The supportive data are presented separately.	0
186217	"The related issues of whom to treat with antihypertensive therapy, and goal blood pressure in older adult patients with isolated systolic hypertension, are discussed separately."	1
186218	It is important to keep in mind that there is a meaningful difference between goal blood pressure and achieved blood pressure.	0
186219	"Many trials have demonstrated that lower achieved blood pressure is associated with superior outcomes, while comparatively few trials have directly evaluated two different goal (ie, target) blood pressures."	0
186220	There is conflicting evidence related to the possible risk of excessive reduction in the diastolic blood pressure.	0
186221	"Rather than demonstrating a progressive benefit at lower pressures, many trials revealed a J-shaped curve in which the risk of cardiac events declines as the diastolic pressure falls from above 100 mmHg to 85 mmHg, but then rises back up at pressures below 80 to 85 mmHg."	0
186222	"By comparison, there is little evidence suggesting a J-curve for the systolic blood pressure, other than perhaps isolated systolic hypertension (see below)."	0
186223	The following sections will review some of the evidence suggesting that a J-shaped curve does (positive studies) or does not exist (negative studies) for the treatment of diastolic hypertension.	0
186224	Several long-term reports in patients with diastolic hypertension have evaluated the incidence of cardiovascular complications according to the mean in-study diastolic BP.	1
186225	"As mentioned, an enhanced cardiovascular risk of cardiac events has been observed in some studies with diastolic pressures below 80 to 85 mmHg."	0
186226	"This was observed, for example, among individuals greater than 65 years of age who were participants in the NHANES II survey cited above."	1
186227	"For a fixed systolic pressure, decreased diastolic pressures below approximately 80 to 90 mmHg were associated with increasing mortality."	0
186228	It is possible that patients with coronary disease do worse at these lower pressures because much of coronary perfusion occurs during diastole;	1
186229	"alternatively, low diastolic blood pressures may be a reflection of underlying severe vascular disease, or other chronic illness."	0
186230	Observations from the Framingham study are compatible with the potential importance of underlying coronary disease;	0
186231	a J-shaped curve for coronary deaths was noted for patients who had a myocardial infarction but not for those who did not.	1
186232	"Similarly, in the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial, there was an increased risk for myocardial infarction, but a lower risk of stroke, with achieved diastolic blood pressures below 85 mmHg, as well as in people with vascular disease in the ONTARGET and INVEST trials."	1
186233	"A secondary analysis of the INVEST trial of over 22,000 patients demonstrated a strong J-shaped relationship between diastolic blood pressure and adverse outcomes (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke)."	0
186234	"In this study, however, more patients with a mean follow-up diastolic blood pressure less than 70 mmHg had a history of myocardial infarction and heart failure than those with higher diastolic pressures (>40 versus <30 percent, and 10 versus 5 percent, respectively)."	1
186235	"The J-shaped relationship was markedly attenuated in multivariate analyses adjusted for myocardial infarction, heart failure, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, suggesting that the J-shaped relationship is partly related to underlying coronary artery disease."	0
186236	Two important factors must be considered from these observations.	0
186237	"First, the increase in risk has been noted only at relatively low diastolic pressures, below 70 to 75 mmHg."	0
186238	"Second, as will be described in the next section, randomized trials with placebo control have shown a similar J-curve in both treated and placebo groups and for noncardiovascular as well as cardiovascular mortality, suggesting that patients with lower diastolic pressures are at higher risk independent of antihypertensive therapy."	1
186239	"There are a number of studies that raise serious questions about the importance of the J-curve relating to diastolic blood pressure reduction with antihypertensive medications at usual levels of BP control: During the first two years of follow-up of over 5000 subjects with a history of a myocardial infarction, there was no detectable association between systolic BP and coronary mortality."	0
186240	"Over the ensuing 14 years, however, linear associations were noted between the risk of coronary death and both systolic and diastolic pressure;"	0
186241	patients with lower pressures were at lower risk.	1
186242	The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study suggested that more aggressive BP lowering (systolic pressure below 130 mmHg) slows the rate of progression of chronic renal disease in patients excreting more than 1 to 2 g of protein per day.	1
186243	An incidental observation was a direct relation between the systolic and diastolic pressures and hospitalization for a first cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event.	0
186244	"From the first (88 to 119 mmHg) to the fourth (>138 mmHg) quartiles of systolic pressure, the likelihood of such an event increased progressively from 0.4 to 2.2 to 2.9 to 5.8 percent per patient year of follow-up."	0
186245	"In a prospective evaluation of over 6000 patients for nine years, a J-curve did not appear except in patients with mild to moderate hypertension whose diastolic pressure was aggressively lowered by more than 25 mmHg from the baseline value."	1
186246	"In the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP), treated older adult patients with isolated systolic hypertension (and an initial diastolic pressure averaging 77 mmHg) had a lower incidence of both cerebrovascular and coronary events despite a reduction of the diastolic pressure to below 70 mmHg."	1
186247	The issue of the J-curve was also addressed in a meta-analysis that analyzed individual patient data from seven randomized trials of both diastolic and isolated systolic hypertension.	0
186248	"Although a J-curve was detected for mortality in relation to diastolic pressure, it was seen in both treated and untreated patients and was not specific for cardiovascular mortality."	0
186249	The authors concluded that the J-curve is probably explained by poor health associated with lower blood pressures rather than an adverse effect of antihypertensive therapy.	0
186250	"In contrast, another meta-analysis of randomized, placebo controlled trials including more than 28,000 patients found that lowering blood pressure was beneficial even in individuals with diastolic blood pressure below 70 mmHg, as long as the systolic blood pressure was lowered."	1
186251	The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) trial was designed to settle the controversy over whether the J-curve exists by comparing outcomes among patients randomized to three different diastolic pressure goals.	1
186252	"In this prospective study, almost 19,000 patients (average pretreatment blood pressure of 170/105 mmHg) were randomly assigned to target diastolic pressures of <=90, <=85, or <=80 mmHg."	1
186253	Treatment was begun with the long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker felodipine (5 mg once a day).	0
186254	Either an ACE inhibitor or a beta-blocker was added if the target pressure was not obtained with initial therapy.	0
186255	Further therapeutic options included increasing the doses of these agents or adding a diuretic.	0
186256	"After an average follow-up period of approximately four years, 78, 41, 28, and 22 percent of patients were taking felodipine, an ACE inhibitor, a beta-blocker, and a diuretic, respectively."	0
186257	The trial outcome was negative.	0
186258	"Two significant problems emerged that clouded the power of this study: Since the cardiovascular event rate was lower than had been anticipated, the study duration was prolonged."	0
186259	Less separation in the diastolic blood pressure was achieved among the three target groups than had been planned;	0
186260	"the mean diastolic blood pressures attained for the <=90, <=85 mmHg, or <=80 mmHg groups were 85, 83, and 81 mmHg, respectively."	0
186261	"The respective mean systolic blood pressures were 144, 141, and 140 mmHg."	0
186262	This close degree of blood pressure reduction among the three groups fails to provide the power to detect any difference in protection with varying degrees of blood pressure lowering.	0
186263	The data therefore did not disprove or prove the existence of a J-curve.	0
186264	"An analysis of the correlation between adverse cardiovascular events and blood pressures achieved with antihypertensive therapy revealed that the fewest major events ) and the lowest cardiovascular mortality were noted at average blood pressures of 138/83 and 139/86 mmHg, respectively."	0
186265	"Lower blood pressures were not associated with a further change in the number of adverse events, except for an apparent increase in mortality in those in whom the diastolic pressure was reduced to below 70 mmHg."	0
186266	"Subsequent subgroup analyses of the HOT trial found that smokers randomly assigned to the two lower diastolic blood pressure values, compared with those assigned to the less than 90 mmHg target, had significant increases in the risk of major cardiovascular events (RR 1.71), stroke (RR 2.44), cardiovascular death (RR 2.67), total death (RR 2.03), sudden death (RR 2.93), but not myocardial infarction."	0
186267	"Although this adverse effect may be due to chance, support for its validity includes the large number of smokers studied (nearly 3000 patients);"	0
186268	smoking was included in the randomization;	0
186269	and no baseline differences in characteristics were noted among smokers in the three randomized categories.	0
186270	"The possible reasons for this finding, if true, are unclear."	0
186271	"Isolated systolic hypertension is considered to be present when the blood pressure is >=140/<90 mmHg and isolated diastolic hypertension, which is discussed elsewhere, is considered to be present when the blood pressure is <140/>=90 mmHg."	0
186272	"The benefit of blood pressure reduction in patients with isolated systolic hypertension was demonstrated in a meta-analysis that included eight outcome trials of 15,693 patients >=60 years of age with isolated systolic hypertension (including SHEP, Syst-Eur, and MRC described below)."	1
186273	"At a median follow-up of 3.8 years, the number of patients who needed to be treated for five years to prevent one major cardiovascular event was lower in men (18 versus 38 in women), patients aged 70 or more (19 versus 39 in patients under age 70), and those with previous cardiovascular complications (16 versus 37 without such a history)."	1
186274	"Total mortality correlated directly with systolic blood pressure (BP) at study entry, but inversely with diastolic BP."	0
186275	"However, diastolic BP was not significantly associated with outcome for combined fatal and nonfatal events."	0
186276	Many of the above reports did not support a J-curve for the systolic pressure.	0
186277	"The risk of cardiovascular disease generally declines continuously at least down to a systolic pressure of 130 to 140 mmHg overall and down to a systolic pressure of 120 mmHg in certain patient populations, such patients with diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease."	1
186278	"Some evidence, however, suggests that a J-curve exists for the development of stroke and other cardiovascular events among patients with isolated systolic hypertension in whom low-normal diastolic pressures are lowered further by antihypertensive therapy."	1
186279	"However, the question of how much the blood pressure should be lowered in older adult patients with isolated systolic hypertension is uncertain in view of evidence that adverse outcomes are seen with low diastolic blood pressures."	1
186280	"In the Rotterdam Study involving 2351 older adult hypertensives, those who received antihypertensive therapy experienced a progressive decrease in the incidence of stroke as their diastolic blood pressure was lowered to the 65 to 74 mmHg range."	0
186281	"However, a significant increase in stroke was observed when the diastolic blood pressure was lowered to less than 65 mmHg."	0
186282	"In a reanalysis of data from the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, those who experienced a cardiovascular event while on antihypertensive drug therapy had lower diastolic levels than those who did not have an event (65 versus 68 mmHg)."	0
186283	"Overall, a decrease of 5 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure (which initially averaged 77 mmHg) in treated patients was associated with statistically significant increases in all cardiovascular events and in stroke (14 and 11 percent, respectively), particularly at pressures <=60 mmHg."	0
186284	"Three factors must be considered when interpreting these findings: Lower diastolic pressures may reflect less aortic compliance due to atherosclerosis, rather than excessive blood pressure reduction."	0
186285	"If so, then lower diastolic pressures with therapy are a marker for not a cause of worse outcomes."	0
186286	The risk in patients with lower diastolic pressures was still less than in placebo-treated patients whose systolic pressures remained elevated.	1
186287	"In the meta-analysis described above, which included two trials of isolated systolic hypertension, a J-curve for mortality in relation to systolic pressure was noted."	0
186288	"However, it was seen in both treated and untreated patients and was not specific for cardiovascular mortality."	0
186289	Similar findings were noted for diastolic pressure.	0
186290	The authors concluded that the J-curve is probably explained by poor health associated with lower blood pressures rather than an adverse effect of antihypertensive therapy.	0
186291	"In summary, there is no clear evidence supporting a treatment-related J-curve in patients with isolated systolic hypertension."	1
186292	"Nevertheless, careful monitoring is advised when treating older adult patients who start with low diastolic pressures."	1
186293	The goal blood pressures presented below refer to the levels at which more intensive antihypertensive therapy to produce a further reduction in BP is not recommended.	0
186294	"These goals are in keeping with the seventh Joint National Committee (JNC 7) report and assume that the patient is at average risk (eg, uncomplicated hypertension)."	0
186295	The following recommendations assume that the BP is being accurately measured.	0
186296	"They also assume that the BP is being gradually reduced, since acute lowering of the BP in patients with severe underlying hypertension can lead to deleterious cerebrovascular and coronary events."	1
186297	The goal of antihypertensive therapy in patients with uncomplicated combined systolic and diastolic hypertension is a blood pressure of <140/<90 mmHg;	1
186298	treatment goals are determined by the higher BP category.	0
186299	"More intensive BP lowering may be warranted in some patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure."	1
186300	"In a number of conditions (eg, heart failure, post-myocardial infarction), antihypertensive drugs are given to improve survival, independent of the blood pressure."	0
186301	"In these cases, lower blood pressure levels may be accepted to permit sufficient drug doses."	0
186302	These uses are discussed separately in the appropriate topic reviews.	0
186303	"For hypertensive patients aged below 80 years, with an elevated systolic pressure, the goal systolic pressure is less than 140 mmHg."	1
186304	"However, as described above, the diastolic blood pressure should be reduced to a minimum posttreatment diastolic pressure of >60 mmHg overall or perhaps >65 mmHg in patients with known coronary artery disease unless symptoms that could be attributable to hypoperfusion occur at higher pressures."	1
186305	"In many cases, the level of systolic blood pressure that is reached with two or three antihypertensive agents (even if greater than 140 mmHg) may be a more reasonable interim goal."	0
186306	"For hypertensive patients of all ages with an elevated diastolic pressure, the goal diastolic pressure is less than 90 mmHg."	1
186307	A lower goal blood pressure than described in the preceding sections may be beneficial in the following clinical settings;	0

186310	Chronic kidney disease.	0
186311	Heart failure.	0
186312	"Whether blood pressure is measured in the clinic or at home, an average of multiple measurements provides a more accurate assessment of blood pressure control than single measurements."	0
186313	This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere.	0
186314	The marked variations in risk of mortality with increased pulse pressure suggest that this parameter alone should not be used for prognostic or therapeutic decisions.	0

186324	Systolic and diastolic hypertension in the general population are defined as a blood pressure >=140/>=90 mmHg measured on at least three separate occasions.	0
186325	Randomized controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefit in patients with systolic and diastolic hypertension that was most pronounced in severe (diastolic pressures of 115 to 129 mmHg) and moderate (diastolic pressures of 105 to 114 mmHg) disease.	1
186326	The absolute benefit of blood pressure lowering is much lower in patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressures of 90 to 104 mmHg).	1
186327	There are no randomized trials that have evaluated the efficacy of treating mild hypertension in patients with baseline systolic pressures of 140 to 149 mmHg.	1
186328	"The three largest randomized trials that have been performed in patients with mild hypertension were the Medical Research Council trial, the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, and the FEVER trial."	1
186329	"All showed significant benefit from antihypertensive therapy, which lowered the mean blood pressure to less than 140 mmHg systolic and/or less than 90 mmHg diastolic."	0
186330	"In the general hypertensive population of adults <80 years of age (ie, not including patients at increased risk), we agree with major societies that recommend a goal blood pressure of <140/<90 mmHg."	1
186331	"However, supportive data for such a goal in patients with grade or stage 1 hypertension (systolic 140 to 159 mmHg and/or diastolic 90 to 99 mmHg) are limited."	1
186332	The goal blood pressure may be lower in patients at increased risk due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes mellitus or in patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease.	1
186333	Specific recommendations and supportive data are presented separately.	0
186334	There is conflicting evidence related to the possible risk of excessive reduction in the diastolic blood pressure.	0
186335	"Rather than demonstrating a progressive benefit at lower pressures, many trials revealed a J-shaped curve in which the risk of cardiac events declines as the diastolic pressure falls from above 100 mmHg to approximately 85 mmHg, but then rises back up at pressures below 80 to 85 mmHg )."	0
186336	"By comparison, there is little evidence suggesting a J-curve for the systolic blood pressure, other than perhaps isolated systolic hypertension."	0
186337	"Isolated systolic hypertension is considered to be present when the blood pressure is >=140/<90 mmHg, and isolated diastolic hypertension, which is discussed elsewhere, is considered to be present when the blood pressure is <140/>=90 mmHg."	0
186338	Specific recommendations and supportive data are presented elsewhere.	0
186339	"Whether blood pressure is measured in the clinic or at home, an average of multiple measurements provides a more accurate assessment of blood pressure control than single measurements."	0
186340	This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere.	0
186952	"Treatment of hypertension generally begins with nonpharmacologic therapy, including moderate dietary sodium restriction, weight reduction in the obese, avoidance of excess alcohol intake, and regular aerobic exercise  . Institution of these modalities involves little or no risk and they all may be beneficial from a general health viewpoint even in normotensive subjects."	0
186953	"Drug therapy, in comparison, may be expensive and is often associated with side effects, some of which (hypokalemia and hyperlipidemia) may actually increase coronary risk."	0
186954	"Thus, there should be clear evidence of likely benefit before antihypertensive drugs are begun."	0
186955	Such evidence is now available for most degrees of hypertension (systolic pressure >=140 mmHg and especially for diastolic pressure persistently >=90 mmHg).	0
186956	There are also controversial data suggesting that treatment of prehypertension may lower the risk of developing sustained hypertension.	0
186957	"The evidence that treating different degrees of hypertension is beneficial will be reviewed here, with recommendations for who should be treated."	0
186958	"An overview of the treatment of hypertension, the choice of antihypertensive drug as initial therapy, and goal blood pressure are discussed separately."	0
186959	Major societies have published definitions of hypertension.	0
186960	"In general, hypertension was defined as a blood pressure >=140/>=90 mmHg."	0
186961	"However, subsequent trials have identified groups of patients at higher risk in whom goal blood pressures below this value may be associated with improved outcomes."	1
186962	The following definitions were suggested in 2003 by the seventh Joint National Committee (JNC 7) based upon the average of two or more properly measured readings at each of two or more visits after an initial screen : Normal blood pressure: systolic <120 mmHg and diastolic <80 mmHg.	0
186963	Prehypertension: systolic 120 to 139 mmHg or diastolic 80 to 89 mmHg.	0
186964	Hypertension:  Stage 1: systolic 140 to 159 mmHg or diastolic 90 to 99 mmHg.	0
186965	Stage 2: systolic >=160 mmHg or diastolic >=100 mmHg.	0
186966	Isolated systolic hypertension is considered to be present when the blood pressure is >=140/<90 mmHg and isolated diastolic hypertension is considered to be present when the blood pressure is <140/>=90 mmHg.	0
186967	These definitions apply to adults on no antihypertensive medications and who are not acutely ill.	1
186968	"If there is a disparity in category between the systolic and diastolic pressures, the higher value determines the severity of the hypertension."	0
186969	The systolic pressure is the greater predictor of risk in patients over the age of 50 to 60.	1
186970	Similar but not identical definitions were suggested in the European Societies of Hypertension and Cardiology guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension that were published in 2007: Optimal blood pressure: systolic <120 mmHg and diastolic <80 mmHg.	0
186971	Normal: systolic 120 to 129 mmHg and/or diastolic 80 to 84 mmHg.	0
186972	High normal: systolic 130 to 139 mmHg and/or diastolic 85 to 89 mmHg.	0
186973	Hypertension:  Grade 1: systolic 140 to 159 mmHg and/or diastolic 90 to 99 mmHg.	0
186974	Grade 2: systolic 160 to 179 mmHg and/or diastolic 100 to 109 mmHg.	0
186975	Grade 3: systolic >=180 and/or diastolic >=110 mmHg.	0
186976	Isolated systolic hypertension: systolic >=140 mmHg and <90 mmHg.	0
186977	"Both the seventh Joint National Committee (JNC 7) and the European Societies of Hypertension and Cardiology (ESH-ESC) guidelines provided different threshold levels to define hypertension when blood pressure was measured by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring or by home blood pressure monitoring: 24-hour average blood pressure or the average of reading from home blood pressure monitoring - Normotension is defined as a blood pressure less than 130/80 mmHg, and hypertension is defined as a blood pressure greater than or equal to 135/85 mmHg."	0
186978	"Daytime (awake) blood pressure by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring - Normotension is defined as a blood pressure less than 135/85 mmHg, and hypertension is defined as a blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg."	0
186979	"Nighttime (asleep) blood pressure by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring - Normotension is defined as a blood pressure less than 120/70 mmHg, and hypertension is defined as a blood pressure greater than or equal to 125/75 mmHg."	0
186980	These definitions of hypertension using alternate measurement techniques are discussed elsewhere.	0
186981	The above definitions of hypertension were based upon studies demonstrating an increase in cardiovascular risk that could be reduced by antihypertensive therapy.	0
186982	"In general, epidemiologic studies of treated and untreated patients reveal that there is a gradually increasing incidence of coronary disease and stroke and cardiovascular mortality as the blood pressure rises above 110/75 mmHg, with some notable differences in risk based upon age and underlying comorbid conditions  . A similar relationship has been described in patients with known coronary disease."	1
186983	"In addition, at any blood pressure, the cardiovascular risk is importantly affected by the presence or absence of other risk factors  . A caveat to the following discussion is that epidemiologic observations of increased risk at blood pressures above 110/75 mmHg but below the hypertensive range do not prove causality."	0
186984	"As an example, increasing blood pressures below the hypertensive range could be associated with other risk factors that could explain worse outcomes, such as increasing body weight and diabetes mellitus."	0
186985	Proof of causality can only be provided by randomized trials that show that cardiovascular outcomes are improved by lowering the blood pressure.	0
186986	The relative prognostic importance of different levels of blood pressure components in individuals of different ages was studied among participants in the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II).	1
186987	"In this cohort study of 7830 participants between the ages of 30 to 74 years who were initially free of cardiovascular disease, the baseline blood pressure was correlated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality over a 15 year follow-up;"	1
186988	the analysis did not take into account whether the patients were or were not treated for hypertension.	1
186989	"Over this period, 1588 patients died, with cardiovascular disease being responsible for 582."	0
186990	"Unlike other studies, the analysis was based upon a risk model that utilized the clear correlation between systolic and diastolic blood pressures to estimate the risk for different baseline blood pressure combinations."	0
186991	"The following mortality results were obtained beyond the first two years of follow-up: Among participants less than 65 years of age, increases in the systolic blood pressure were linearly related to increases in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality at all diastolic blood pressures."	1
186992	"By comparison, the correlation between diastolic blood pressure and mortality was ""hockey stick-shaped""."	0
186993	"This shape corresponds to a flat region of risk with diastolic values below 80 mmHg, with a marked increase in risk occurring with values above this level."	0
186994	"Among those greater than 65 years of age, increases in the systolic blood pressure were also linearly related to increased mortality at all diastolic pressures."	0
186995	"However, the risk with the diastolic blood pressure was J-shaped;"	0
186996	"thus, for a fixed systolic pressure, decreased blood pressures below approximately 80 to 90 mmHg were associated with increasing mortality, while levels above approximately 80 to 90 mmHg were associated with an enhanced risk."	0
186997	Why lower diastolic pressures were associated with increased risk is not known.	0
186998	"It is generally thought that lower pressures identify patients with more comorbid disease since treated isolated systolic hypertension improves outcomes even though diastolic pressures are in the ""enhanced risk"" range."	1
186999	"Increased pulse pressure was associated with marked variations in risk of mortality, depending upon age, and the exact systolic and diastolic pressure."	0
187000	"The Framingham Heart Study also reported an increased incidence of poor outcomes as the blood pressure rises, even with values within the ""normal"" range."	0
187001	"This study examined the risk of cardiovascular disease at 10 year follow-up among subjects with ""high-normal"" blood pressure at baseline examination, which was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 130 to 139 mmHg, a diastolic pressure of 85 to 89 mmHg, or both, and with ""normal"" blood pressure, which was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 120 to 129 mmHg, a diastolic pressure of 80 to 84 mmHg, or both."	0
187002	"After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and when compared with optimal blood pressure (defined as systolic and diastolic blood pressures of less than 120 and 80 mmHg, respectively), the hazard ratios for a cardiovascular event at 10 years for those with high-normal values were 2.5 and 1.6 for women and men, respectively."	0
187003	"Patients with ""normal"" blood pressure values also had an increased hazard ratio for a cardiovascular event compared with optimal blood pressure."	1
187004	"Based in part upon this study, the seventh report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7) added a new blood pressure category called prehypertension, which is defined as blood pressure of 120 to 139/80 to 89 mmHg."	0
187005	"In a subsequent analysis of data from the Framingham Heart Study to determine the impact of prehypertension on specific cardiovascular events, it was demonstrated that prehypertension was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk 3.5) and coronary artery disease (relative risk 1.7), but not stroke."	0
187006	"In addition to gender, other patient characteristics can influence the relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes."	0
187007	"In an analysis of data on 8960 participants aged 55 to 64 years in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, individuals with high normal (130 to 139/85 to 89 mmHg) and normal (120 to 129/80 to 85 mmHg) blood pressure had an increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease (RR 2.3 and 1.8, respectively) compared to optimal blood pressure (<120/80 mmHg)."	1
187008	"The risk was substantially more pronounced among black, obese and diabetic individuals."	0
187009	Relative to optimal blood pressure: Relative risk was 3.3 for high normal blood pressure among blacks.	0
187010	Relative risk was 4.1 for high normal blood pressure among diabetics.	0
187011	Relative risk was 3.6 for high normal blood pressure among individuals with a BMI >30 kg/m2.	1
187012	The risk with increased blood pressure also appears to vary markedly from population to population.	0
187013	"As an example, the relationship between blood pressure and mortality from coronary heart disease was evaluated in a 25 year follow-up study of over 12,000 men aged 40 to 59 years without heart disease who resided in seven different countries."	0
187014	"Over this period, nearly 1300 died from coronary heart disease."	0
187015	"The following results were noted: Among all populations, the relative increase in mortality from heart disease for a given increase in blood pressure was similar."	0
187016	"When adjusted for individual variability, the relative risk of death was 1.28 for a 10 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure."	0
187017	"The risk of death in those with a blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg was over three times higher among subjects from the United States and northern Europe compared to those from Japan and southern Europe (70 versus 20 deaths per 10,000 person-years)."	0
187018	"In general, the observation that there is a gradually increasing incidence of coronary disease and stroke and cardiovascular mortality with a rising the blood pressure does not prove a causal relationship."	0
187019	"Rather, increasing blood pressure could be a marker for other risk factors such as increasing body weight, which is associated with dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, and the metabolic syndrome."	0
187020	The best evidence for a causal role of increasing blood pressure in cardiovascular complications is an improvement in outcome with antihypertensive therapy.	0
187021	Treatment studies have demonstrated the efficacy of lowering both diastolic and systolic pressures in patients with hypertension.	1
187022	Blood pressure control to achieve optimal cardiovascular outcomes includes achievement of goal blood pressure at the time of all or most measurements.	0
187023	"This was best studied in a post hoc analysis from the INVEST trial which compared the effectiveness of verapamil and atenolol in over 20,000 hypertensive patients with known coronary artery disease."	1
187024	"All patients, regardless of initial randomization, were divided into four groups according to the proportion of visits in which BP was in control: <25, 25 to <50, 50 to <75, and >=75 percent."	0
187025	"The risk of the primary outcome (death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke) decreased progressively and significantly from the group with the poorest control to the group with the best control during an average follow-up of 2.7 years."	0
187026	"Lowering the blood pressure is also beneficial in some patients who have blood pressures near but not in the hypertensive range, primarily with concomitant conditions such as diabetes and chronic kidney disease."	1
187027	Randomized controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefit in patients with systolic and diastolic hypertension that was most pronounced in severe and moderate disease.	1
187028	"Although the number of patients was small in the severe and moderate hypertension trials, the magnitude of benefit was extremely high."	0
187029	"The best data on the treatment of severe diastolic hypertension come from a trial in the 1960s of 143 men with diastolic pressures of 115 to 129 mmHg (average clinic blood pressure 186/121 mmHg) who were randomly assigned to antihypertensive therapy or placebo, the incidence of cardiovascular events was 3 percent at 21 months in the treated group versus 39 percent at 16 months in the placebo group (p<0.001)."	1
187030	The shorter follow-up in the placebo group was due to the high number of terminating events.	0
187031	The average blood pressure during the trial was significantly lower in the treated group (143/91 mmHg versus no significant change in the placebo).	0
187032	The efficacy of treating moderate diastolic hypertension was demonstrated in a trial of 210 men with diastolic pressures of 105 to 114 mmHg who were randomly assigned to antihypertensive drugs or placebo.	1
187033	The incidence of cardiovascular events at three and a half years was significantly lower in the treated group (8 versus 32 percent; the difference in blood pressure between the groups was -31/-19 mmHg).	0
187034	The absolute benefit of blood-pressure lowering is much lower in patients with mild hypertension (90 to 104 mmHg).	1
187035	A summary of the results from 17 controlled trials of mild to moderate diastolic hypertension (almost all also had systolic hypertension) in adults under age 65 found that active treatment with antihypertensive medications led to a statistically significant 16 percent reduction in the number of coronary events and a 40 percent reduction in stroke.	1
187036	"In the aggregate, antihypertensive therapy of mild hypertension for four to five years prevented a coronary event in 0.7 percent of patients and a cerebrovascular event in 1.3 percent for a total benefit of approximately 2 percent;"	0
187037	this included a reduction in cardiovascular mortality of 0.8 percent.	0
187038	"Thus, 100 patients must be treated for four to five years to prevent a complication in two."	0
187039	"Two potential pitfalls must also be considered in evaluating these findings: They may overestimate the benefit in mild hypertension, since patients with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure as high as 115 mmHg in some studies) were also included."	1
187040	"They may underestimate the total long-term benefit, since the studies were of relatively short duration and mild hypertension is a minor short-term risk."	0
187041	"Thus, some have proposed an actuarial approach in which the benefits expected from the treatment of mild hypertension are estimated by comparison with insurance company actuarial data prior to the availability of antihypertensive therapy."	0
187042	A report from the Framingham Heart Study confirmed the benefit of long-term antihypertensive therapy on cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality.	0
187043	"All cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality over 10 years were significantly lower with antihypertensive therapy: In men, all cause mortality was reduced from 43 to 31 percent and cardiovascular mortality was reduced from 28 to 13 percent."	0
187044	"In women, all cause mortality was reduced from 34 to 21 percent and cardiovascular mortality was reduced from 19 to 9 percent."	0
187045	"Even greater benefits have been shown with the treatment of elderly hypertensives (over age 65), most of whom have isolated systolic hypertension."	0
187046	"Because the elderly start at such higher overall cardiovascular risk, short term reductions in their hypertension provide apparently greater benefits than that observed in younger patients."	0
187047	"However, among treated elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, there is a concern that the low diastolic pressure after therapy may interfere with tissue, particularly coronary, perfusion and possibly increase cardiovascular risk."	1
187048	The related issue of goal blood pressure in hypertensive patients who are treated is discussed separately.	1
187049	The benefit from antihypertensive therapy is unproven in patients with mild hypertension who also have no preexisting cardiovascular disease.	1
187050	"The meta-analysis described above suggested that, in patients with mild hypertension, antihypertensive therapy significantly reduced cardiovascular events by 2 percent."	1
187051	"However, some of the patients included in this meta-analysis had moderate rather than mild hypertension, and some had preexisting cardiovascular disease."	1
187052	A subsequent meta-analysis combined four placebo-controlled trials totalling 8912 patients with mild hypertension and no preexisting cardiovascular disease.	1
187053	"During four to five years of follow-up, antihypertensive therapy produced lower rates of mortality (1.7 versus 2.0 percent) and stroke (0.3 versus 0.6 percent) but higher rates of myocardial infarction (2.0 versus 1.8 percent);"	0
187054	none of these findings were statistically significant.	0
187055	"The total number of events was small in this study, as would be expected among patients with mild hypertension and no cardiovascular disease."	1
187056	"In addition, the four- to five-year follow-up was relatively short;"	0
187057	a benefit from antihypertensive therapy among low-risk patients might require a substantially longer period of time to manifest.	0
187058	"Finally, the Felodipine Event Reduction trial (FEVER) was not included in this meta-analysis, even though patients in the FEVER trial were similar to those enrolled in the trials that were included."	1
187059	"As discussed elsewhere, the antihypertensive therapy in the FEVER trial significantly reduced mortality and cardiovascular events."	0
187060	"Thus, low-risk patients with mild hypertension and no preexisting cardiovascular disease who fail to reduce their blood pressure with lifestyle modification should receive antihypertensive therapy."	1
187061	"The systolic pressure is the most important determinant of risk in hypertensive patients, particularly in patients over the age of 50 to 60."	1
187062	The value of treating isolated systolic hypertension has been demonstrated in multiple clinical trials.	0
187063	"In the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) trial, for example, it was estimated that approximately 18 patients had to be treated for five years to prevent a major cerebrovascular or cardiac event in one."	0
187064	"However, these results underestimate the true benefit of effective therapy, since about 30 percent of treated patients did not reach goal blood pressure and 44 percent of patients in the placebo group ended up being treated at five years."	1
187065	These issues are discussed in detail separately.	0
187066	Isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) is defined as a diastolic pressure >=90 mmHg with a systolic pressure less than 140 mmHg.	0
187067	"IDH is more common in younger men who are overweight or obese and, in individuals under age 40, it is more common than systolic and diastolic hypertension (SDH) or isolated systolic hypertension (ISH)."	1
187068	The magnitude of this effect was illustrated in a 2001 report from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III in the United States of untreated patients with hypertension.	1
187069	"IDH accounted for almost 60 percent of cases under age 40, approximately 35 percent between the ages of 40 and 49, and was rare in patients over age 60."	1
187070	"In contrast to the demonstrated efficacy in the preceding sections of treating SDH and ISH, there are no randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of therapy in patients with IDH."	1
187071	"Thus, decisions about antihypertensive therapy are based upon the natural history of IDH and the risk of cardiovascular complications."	0
187072	The natural history of untreated IDH was evaluated in a report from the Framingham Heart Study.	0
187073	"Among 193 individuals with new onset IDH, 106 progressed to systolic and diastolic hypertension at a mean follow-up of 6.7 years (55 percent, adjusted hazard ratio 23 compared to optimal blood pressure [<120/<80 mmHg])."	1
187074	The risk of cardiovascular complications appears to be lower with IDH than with SDH and ISH.	0
187075	This could reflect one or both of the following: most patients are under age 40;	1
187076	and IDH may be associated with a lower cardiovascular risk.	0
187077	"Furthermore, some but not all studies have suggested that IDH is not associated with an increase in risk compared to normotensive individuals."	0
187078	A limitation to all of these studies is that it is not clear that the initial classification at baseline remained applicable during follow-up.	0
187079	The conflicting findings on prognosis of IDH can be illustrated by the following observations: No increase in all-cause mortality with IDH as defined above was noted at up to 32 years of follow-up in a prospective cohort study from Finland of 3267 initially healthy men 32 to 45 years of age who were not receiving antihypertensive drugs.	0
187080	The patients with IDH also had a low rate of using antihypertensive drugs during follow-up.	1
187081	"In contrast, a high rate of progression of IDH to systolic and diastolic hypertension (55 percent in 6.7 years) noted in the Framingham Heart Study."	0
187082	"In addition, a 10-year follow-up Chinese study of over 26,500 subjects who were 35 years of age or older at baseline found that patients with IDH had, compared to normotensive patients, a significantly increased risk of stroke (relative risk 2.16 compared to 2.96 and 2.35 in patients with SDH and ISH, respectively)."	1
187083	There are no definitive data that address optimal therapy in patients with IDH.	1
187084	There is agreement among the authors and editors of this topic on the following steps: The blood pressure as in all patients should be measured on at least three separate occasions to confirm the diagnosis.	0
187085	"Nonpharmacologic therapy is warranted, particularly salt restriction and weight loss in patients who are overweight which, as noted above, is common in IDH."	1
187086	"The patient should be tested for evidence of end-organ damage, such as proteinuria and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG, and for hypothyroidism, which has been associated with a rise in blood pressure more pronounced with diastolic compared to systolic pressure."	1
187087	Treatment with antihypertensive drugs is warranted in all patients with IDH who have evidence of end-organ damage.	1
187088	"Most experts also suggest the use of antihypertensive drugs in patients without end-organ damage based upon the general recommendation in major society guidelines that the general goal blood pressure is <140/<90 mmHg, with lower values suggested in selected patients at increased risk."	1
187089	Most patients with IDH should be able to attain goal blood pressure with a single drug.	1
187090	"The choice of drug is discussed in detail elsewhere and depends in part upon whether there are specific indications for a particular class of drug (eg, beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers for rate control in atrial fibrillation)."	0
187091	"Among patients without an indication for a particular class of drugs, younger patients such as those with IDH generally respond better to monotherapy with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker than a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker."	1
187092	It has been suggested that there is an enhanced risk for cardiovascular events associated with increases in the pulse pressure (defined as the systolic minus diastolic pressure).	0
187093	This issue is discussed in detail separately.	0
187094	The goal blood pressure in all patients is less than 140/90 mmHg.	0
187095	Some groups of patients may benefit from a lower goal blood pressure.	0
187096	This issue is discussed separately.	0
187097	"Using the above definitions from JNC 7, the following general approach can be used to determine which patients with hypertension require antihypertensive therapy."	1
187098	This approach largely includes the recommendations of JNC 7 for risk stratification and treatment and assumes accurate measurement of the blood pressure  . The potential errors involved with this procedure are discussed elsewhere.	0
187099	All patients should undergo appropriate lifestyle (nonpharmacologic) modification.	0
187100	"In the absence of evidence for hypertensive target organ damage, the following decisions about antihypertensive medications are generally not made until there has been an adequate trial of nonpharmacologic therapy."	0
187101	"However, if there is evidence for target organ damage, decisions on antihypertensive medications may be warranted earlier."	0
187102	"In the absence of end-organ damage, a patient should not be labeled as having hypertension unless the blood pressure is persistently elevated after three to six visits over a several month period."	0
187103	"In one study, for example, there was a mean 15/7 reduction in blood pressure in untreated patients between the first and third visits to a new physician."	1
187104	This difference has prognostic importance.	0
187105	The Medical Research Council Mild Hypertension Trial found a close correlation between cardiovascular risk and the systolic pressure measured three months after entry into the trial.	0
187106	"In contrast, a transient increase in systolic pressure at entry due to a white coat response was not associated with increased risk."	0
187107	"During the initial evaluation period before a therapeutic decision is made, patients should also be encouraged to measure their blood pressure at home or work."	0
187108	"Antihypertensive medications should generally be begun if the systolic pressure is persistently >=140 mmHg and/or the diastolic pressure is persistently >=90 mmHg in the office and at home, despite attempted nonpharmacologic therapy."	0
187109	"Thus, systolic and diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension, and isolated diastolic hypertension all should be treated."	0
187110	"Isolated diastolic hypertension is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but there are no treatment trials to prove benefit from antihypertensive therapy."	0
187111	Starting with two drugs may be considered in patients with a baseline blood pressure more than 20/10 mmHg above goal.	1
187112	"This strategy may increase the likelihood that target blood pressures are achieved in a reasonable time period, but should be used cautiously in patients at increased risk for orthostatic hypotension (such as diabetics and the elderly)."	1
187113	"In some patients with chronic kidney disease or known cardiovascular disease, antihypertensive therapy may be indicated when the systolic pressure is persistently above 130 mmHg and/or the diastolic pressure is above 80 mmHg )."	1
187114	The benefit of such blood pressure lowering in patients with chronic kidney disease is probably limited to patients excreting more than 0.5 to 1 g of protein per day.	1
187115	"Patients with office hypertension, normal values at home, and no evidence of end-organ damage should undergo ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to see if they are truly hypertensive."	1
187116	"On the other hand, 5 to 20 percent of patients with normal office readings have been found to have elevated out-of-the office readings by 24 hour automatic ambulatory blood pressure monitoring."	1
187117	"These patients with ""masked"" hypertension appear to have an increased cardiovascular risk similar to those with elevated office and ambulatory readings."	1
187118	"In a number of conditions (eg, heart failure, post-myocardial infarction), antihypertensive drugs are given to improve survival, independent of the blood pressure."	0
187119	These uses are discussed separately in the appropriate topic reviews.	0
187120	The importance of other risk factors on both cardiovascular risk and the likelihood of a beneficial response to antihypertensive therapy should not be underestimated.	0
187121	"In the MRC trial, for example, the number of patients with mild hypertension who had to be treated for five years to prevent one cardiovascular complication was 262 in the absence of any risk factors but only four in high-risk patients who smoked, were older than 55, and had a systolic pressure above 160 mmHg."	1
187122	"Furthermore, cessation of smoking alone rapidly decreases coronary risk by approximately 35 to 40 percent, a benefit that is independent of the duration of smoking."	0
187123	"Patients with prehypertension (systolic 120 to 139 mmHg and/or diastolic 80 to 89 mmHg), but without diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease are treated with nonpharmacologic therapies such as weight reduction, sodium restriction, and avoidance of excess alcohol )."	1
187124	"They should also have their blood pressure measured at least annually, or more frequently if home monitoring is available, since they are at significant risk of developing hypertension over time."	0
187125	"As mentioned above, individuals with prehypertension have an increased risk of cardiovascular events over time compared to those with normal blood pressure . However, there are as yet no data that lowering the blood pressure in this setting reduces cardiovascular risk, although antihypertensive therapy may delay overt hypertension."	1
187126	"UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."""	0
187127	"The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition."	0

197039	"Although most cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed and treated while disease is localized, some men have evidence of metastatic at presentation and others develop disseminated disease after their definitive treatment."	0
197040	Contemporary research has led to the development of multiple active treatment modalities for men with advanced disease.	0
197041	"Management of men with advanced prostate cancer involves the sequential use of these and older approaches, with the goals of prolonging survival, minimizing complications, and maintaining quality of life."	0
197042	An overview of treatment options for patients with disseminated prostate cancer and considerations for the proper sequencing of the various treatment options are presented here.	1
197043	The initial management of men with localized prostate cancer is discussed separately: (See.	0
197044	(See.	0
197045	Some men with prostate cancer will have overt metastases either at presentation or as their first sign of recurrence following definitive therapy.	1
197046	"In the vast majority of cases, such metastases are predominantly osteoblastic lesions in the axial skeleton."	0
197047	"However, in some cases the only manifestation of disseminated disease is an elevated or rising serum PSA after definitive therapy."	0
197048	Systemic therapy options for men in whom the only evidence of disseminated disease is an elevated PSA are the same as those for men with overt metastases.	0
197049	"However, disease manifested only by an elevated serum PSA may have a very prolonged natural history, which has significant implications for the timing and choice of therapy."	0
197050	Previously untreated prostate cancer is dependent upon androgen at least initially for its continued growth in most cases.	0
197051	"Androgen production occurs primarily in the testes, which account for 90 to 95 percent of total circulating testosterone;"	0
197052	testicular production of androgen is regulated by the hypothalamic pituitary axis.	0
197053	The adrenal glands produce the remainder of the circulating androgens.	0
197054	"These observations provide the rationale for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which is the standard initial approach for patients with metastatic prostate cancer or an elevated serum PSA when systemic therapy is indicated."	1
197055	ADT can be accomplished either with bilateral orchiectomy (surgical castration) or medical orchiectomy.	0
197056	"Patients being managed with ADT who have evidence of disease progression (increasing serum PSA, new clinical metastases, progression of existing metastases) are considered to have castrate resistant disease."	1
197057	Contemporary research in men with castrate resistant prostate cancer has led to the development of multiple agents that improved overall survival in phase III trials.	1
197058	"These include agents that interfere with androgenic stimulation of prostate cancer growth ( abiraterone, enzalutamide), taxane chemotherapy (docetaxel, cabazitaxel), immunotherapy (sipuleucel-T), and a bone targeted radiopharmaceutical (radium-223)."	0
197059	"In addition, there are a number of older endocrine approaches that may retain utility in selected situations and have not been adequately studied in randomized trials."	0
197060	These newer therapeutic approaches have each been evaluated in a relative limited segment of the potential patient population and have not been compared with each other in randomized trials.	0
197061	The observed benefit in survival with each is of similar magnitude and results cannot be directly compared because of differences in patient populations.	0
197062	The proper sequencing of these newer approaches requires a consideration of multiple factors.	0
197063	"The sites and extent of disease involvement, along with the rate of disease progression, are particularly important considerations in choosing therapy."	0
197064	None of the newer modalities has been adequately evaluated in men whose only evidence of disseminated disease is an elevated or rising serum PSA after definitive surgery or radiation therapy.	0
197065	The optimal management of patients whose only evidence of disease is a rising or elevated PSA thus is extrapolated from patients with more extensive disease.	1
197066	Sipuleucel-T - The dendritic cell vaccine sipuleucel-T was studied only in the context of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic men with metastases.	0
197067	This approach has not been studied in men whose only evidence of disease is an elevated PSA or in those with symptomatic metastases.	0
197068	"Furthermore, treatment with sipuleucel-T does not affect the serum PSA, restricting this approach to patients with slowly progressive disease where a relatively rapid response to treatment is not required."	1
197069	Abiraterone and enzalutamide - Both abiraterone and enzalutamide act by interfering with the androgenic stimulation of tumor growth.	0
197070	The initial phase III trial with each of these agents was conducted in patients who had progressed after treatment with docetaxel chemotherapy.	1
197071	"However, their mechanism of action, oral administration, and side effect profile may make these agents suitable for use in chemotherapy naive patients once adequate data are available."	0
197072	"Taxane chemotherapy - Cytotoxic chemotherapy with a taxane is generally reserved for patients with relatively rapidly progressive, symptomatic disease for which less toxic approaches are not an appropriate option."	1
197073	Docetaxel is the preferred agent in this setting.	0
197074	Cabazitaxel has only been studied in the context of patients who have progressed on docetaxel.	1
197075	"Radium-223 - The bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical radium-223 is appropriate only for patients with extensive bone metastases but without other visceral metastases, and its evaluation in clinical trials was limited to this setting."	1
197076	"Other factors that may influence the choice of therapy include the route and frequency of administration, side effects, regulatory status, regulatory status, cost, insurance reimbursement, and patient preferences."	0
197077	"In addition, older endocrine approaches (eg, antiandrogens, ketoconazole, steroids) may have an important role, particularly in the management of patients with slowly progressive disease, as a way to forestall using more toxic or expensive alternatives."	1
197078	Patients should be included in clinical trials whenever possible.	0
197079	Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard initial approach for patients when systemic therapy is indicated for metastatic prostate cancer or evidence of disseminated disease based upon serum PSA.	1
197080	ADT can be accomplished either with bilateral orchiectomy (surgical castration) or medical orchiectomy.	0
197081	"Bilateral orchiectomy (surgical castration) is a simple, cost-effective procedure."	0
197082	"Following surgery, serum testosterone levels rapidly decrease to castrate levels."	0
197083	"In many countries, bilateral orchiectomy remains the standard of care for initial hormone therapy of metastatic prostate cancer."	0
197084	"Surgical castration may be particularly useful when an immediate decrease in testosterone is necessary (eg, impending spinal cord compression, urinary tract outlet obstruction) or when cost or adherence to medical therapy are an issue."	0
197085	Medical orchiectomy decreases testicular production of testosterone by its effects on the hypothalamic pituitary axis.	0
197086	"The most widely used approach is continuous treatment with a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, which suppresses luteinizing hormone production and therefore the synthesis of testicular androgens."	0
197087	"With the initiation of treatment with GnRH agonists, there is a transient surge of luteinizing hormone before the luteinizing hormone levels fall."	0
197088	"This surge can cause an increase in serum testosterone, which may result in a worsening of disease."	0
197089	"This ""flare phenomenon"" may be of particular concern in clinical settings such as impending epidural spinal cord compression or urinary tract outflow obstruction."	0
197090	"Antiandrogens (eg, flutamide, bicalutamide) may be useful in preventing the flare phenomenon."	0
197091	"A number of GnRH agonists are available (leuprolide, goserelin, buserelin, triptorelin)."	0
197092	Depot formulations are frequently used to permit less frequent treatment administration.	0
197093	The GnRH antagonist degarelix binds to the GnRH receptors on pituitary gonadotropin-producing cells but does not cause an initial release of luteinizing hormone.	0
197094	Degarelix suppresses testosterone production and avoids the flare phenomenon observed with GnRH agonists;	0
197095	a GnRH antagonist may be a useful alternative to a GnRH antagonist when an immediate decrease in testosterone levels is required.	0
197096	Antiandrogens bind to androgen receptors and competitively inhibit their interaction with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.	0
197097	The use of antiandrogens with a GnRH thus produces a combined androgen blockade.	0
197098	Combined androgen blockade is widely used for two to four weeks during the initiation of treatment with a GnRH agonist in order to prevent a disease flare due to the transient increase in testosterone levels.	0
197099	"Combined androgen blockade is sometimes considered for long-term therapy to improve on the efficacy of a GnRH alone, although its long-term use is limited by costs and increased toxicity."	0
197100	Sequential therapy with ADT alone and the later addition of docetaxel to ADT remains the standard of care.	0
197101	"There is no indication for the addition of chemotherapy to ADT in men with hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer, even though docetaxel can prolong overall survival in men with castrate resistant disease."	0
197102	"In a phase III trial, 385 men with metastatic prostate cancer were randomly assigned to ADT (either a GnRH agonist or orchiectomy) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every three weeks for up to nine cycles) or to ADT alone."	0
197103	"At a median follow-up of 50 months, there was no statistically significant increase in overall survival with the combination compared with ADT alone (median 59 versus 54 months, hazard ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.75-1.36)."	0
197104	"There was a statistically significant increase in biochemical progression free survival, but this was accompanied by a significant increase in the incidence of serious adverse events, particularly neutropenia and febrile neutropenia."	0
197105	"However, this trial was not statistically powered to detect small differences in overall survival."	0
197106	Data from other phase III trials addressing this issue may provide additional insight.	0
197107	Many of the side effects of ADT are due to castrate levels of serum testosterone.	0
197108	"When treatment is withdrawn, serum testosterone levels gradually return toward normal;"	0
197109	discontinuation of long-acting GnRH agonists may be associated with a very slow testosterone recovery.	0
197110	Intermittent ADT has been proposed as a way to minimize the side effects of medical castration by withholding active therapy once patients have responded to treatment.	0
197111	ADT can then be reinstituted when there is evidence of progression.	0
197112	"The time when men are off therapy may be associated with decreased side effects, thereby improving quality of life."	0
197113	"Metastatic disease - Despite the theoretical advantages of this approach, intermittent ADT is not indicated in patients with metastatic prostate cancer unless survival is considered secondary to quality of life."	1
197114	A phase III intergroup trial found that intermittent ADT could not be considered noninferior compared with continuous ADT in terms of overall survival.	0
197115	Rising or elevated PSA only - Intermittent ADT may be appropriate for a subset of men whose only manifestation of disseminated prostate cancer is an elevated or rising serum PSA.	0
197116	A preliminary report of large randomized trial suggested that intermittent ADT was noninferior in terms of overall survival but additional data are required to assess the long-term value of this approach.	0
197117	"In this setting, intermittent ADT should be limited to well-informed patients who understand the potential risks and benefits of this approach."	1
197118	ADT is associated with a wide range of side effects that can significantly impair quality of life.	0
197119	"Important and/or frequent side effects include: Loss of lean body mass, increased body fat, and decreased muscle strength."	0
197120	Sexual dysfunction - Loss of libido in men receiving GnRH agonists usually develops within the first several months and is followed by erectile dysfunction.	0
197121	"Loss of bone mineral density, which can result in bone fracture due to osteoporosis."	0
197122	This effect may be compounded by the presence of bone metastases.	0
197123	"Vasomotor instability, which is manifested by hot flashes."	0
197124	"Gynecomastia, decreased body hair, and smaller penile and/or testicular size."	0
197125	Fatigue or lack of energy.	0
197126	Behavioral and neurologic effects.	0
197127	Cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities.	0
197128	"Although these side effects are potentially significant, they should not preclude the use of ADT in appropriate clinical settings."	0
197129	The optimal time to initiate systemic therapy is uncertain.	0
197130	Hormone therapy for disseminated prostate cancer is not curative and immediate therapy has not been shown to prolong survival compared with delayed therapy.	0
197131	"Furthermore, treatment-related side effects can adversely affect quality of life."	0
197132	"In the setting of patients with overt metastatic disease, several randomized trials and a meta-analysis found that immediate compared to delayed ADT was associated with a statistically significant decrease in prostate cancer-related death although there was no overall survival benefit."	1
197133	The optimal timing for the initiation of ADT for patients with a rising serum PSA is controversial.	1
197134	Proponents of early treatment argue that this approach can delay disease progression and may prolong survival.	0
197135	Others contend that treatment is best deferred until clinical metastases or symptoms develop since there is no consistent evidence for a significant survival benefit with ADT in this setting.	0
197136	"Patients who have evidence of disease progression (eg, increase in serum PSA, new clinical metastases, progression of existing metastases) while being managed with ADT are considered to have castrate resistant disease."	1
197137	The presence of castrate resistant disease does not imply that disease is totally independent of androgens and resistant to further therapies directed at the androgen stimulation of tumor growth.	0
197138	"For patients whose initial ADT was a medical orchiectomy (GnRH agonist or antagonist), such treatment should be continued even when additional systemic treatment is initiated."	1
197139	"Prostate cancer can have a long natural history, and its management may require the sequential use of multiple treatment options."	0
197140	Factors to consider in sequencing these options are discussed separately.	0
197141	"An improved understanding of the role of androgens in stimulating the growth of prostate cancer has lead to the development of abiraterone and enzalutamide, both of which have significantly improved overall survival compared with placebo in phase III trials in patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer."	1
197142	"There are no data on the activity of enzalutamide in patients who have previously been treated with abiraterone, nor are there data on the activity of abiraterone after treatment with enzalutamide."	1
197143	"Androgens produced in the testis can cause ""autocrine/paracrine"" signaling that results in tumor progression."	0
197144	"Abiraterone is an orally administered small molecule that irreversibly inhibits the products of the CYP17 gene (including both 17,20-lyase and 17-alpha-hydroxylase)."	0
197145	"In doing so, abiraterone blocks the synthesis of androgens in the tumor as well as in the testis and adrenal glands."	0
197146	Patients treated with abiraterone are at risk for adrenal insufficiency and require concurrent steroid replacement therapy.	1
197147	"In two phase III trials, abiraterone plus prednisone prolonged overall survival compared with prednisone alone in men who had previously been treated with docetaxel and in those who were chemotherapy naive."	0
197148	Abiraterone is approved for patients who have metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer.	1
197149	"Abiraterone is generally well tolerated, although fluid retention, hypokalemia and hypertension may require treatment."	0
197150	Abiraterone has not been studied in patients who have previously been treated with enzalutamide.	1
197151	"Enzalutamide is an orally administered agent that acts at multiple sites in the androgen receptor signaling pathway, including blocking the binding of androgen to the androgen receptor, inhibition of nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor, and inhibition of the association of the androgen receptor with nuclear DNA."	0
197152	"Unlike abiraterone, concurrent treatment with steroids is not required."	0
197153	"In a phase III trial in men who had received prior docetaxel-based chemotherapy, enzalutamide significantly increased median survival compared with placebo."	0
197154	A second phase III trial is evaluating enzalutamide in chemotherapy naive patients (NCT01212991).	0
197155	"Treatment with enzalutamide has rarely been associated with seizures, and its use is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder."	1
197156	"Enzalutamide is approved for men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer who have received treatment with docetaxel."	0
197157	There are no data on the efficacy of enzalutamide in men who have previously been treated with abiraterone.	1
197158	"Older secondary endocrine treatment options include the addition of antiandrogens to patients treated with a GnRH antagonist alone or with surgical orchiectomy, withdrawal of antiandrogen therapy for patients who have been on an antiandrogen, suppression of adrenal androgen production with ketoconazole or steroids, and estrogens or progesterones."	1
197159	"Overall response rates, generally based upon changes in serum PSA, vary from 20 to 60 percent, and responses tend to be of relatively short duration."	0
197160	"Specific secondary endocrine treatment approaches generally have not been compared with each other in large randomized trials, nor has a survival benefit been demonstrated with these approaches."	0
197161	"However, the sequential use of such endocrine treatments prior to switching to chemotherapy often is preferred because of the generally less severe side effects."	0
197162	These alternative approaches may be used immediately after ADT in patients who have evidence of slow progression as manifested only by an increasing PSA or have asymptomatic metastases.	1
197163	Secondary endocrine approaches may also have a role after chemotherapy in the later phases of disease when there are no other treatment options.	0
197164	"Antiandrogens block the effects of circulating androgens with fewer adverse effects (hot flashes, loss of libido, impotence) than are associated with surgical or medical castration."	0
197165	Antiandrogens may be useful in patients whose initial ADT included either medical orchiectomy with a GnRH alone or surgical orchiectomy.	1
197166	"There is incomplete cross-resistance between antiandrogens, and substitution of one antiandrogen for another occasionally is useful."	0
197167	"Available nonsteroidal antiandrogens include flutamide, bicalutamide, and nilutamide."	0
197168	The steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate is approved for this indication outside the United States.	0
197169	"The so-called ""antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome"" refers to a decline in serum PSA that is sometimes observed following the withdrawal of an antiandrogen in men who had progressed while being managed with complete androgen blockade."	0
197170	"Approximately 20 percent of men progressing after complete androgen blockade have a PSA or ""biochemical"" response when antiandrogens are withdrawn, and some experience symptomatic or objective improvement."	0
197171	"For men who have progressed while on complete androgen blockade, the first therapeutic maneuver is the discontinuation of the antiandrogen."	0
197172	Other therapy generally should not be initiated until adequate time has elapsed to assess for a possible withdrawal response.	0
197173	Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent that inhibits adrenal androgen synthesis.	0
197174	Ketoconazole also has a direct cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer cells.	0
197175	Serum testosterone levels decline to castrate levels within 24 hours and antitumor efficacy is rapid.	0
197176	"Adverse effects (nausea and vomiting, skin rash, fatigue, asthenia) and drug interactions may limit the use of ketoconazole in some patients."	0
197177	"Glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone) reduce pituitary production of ACTH, resulting in suppression of adrenal steroidogenesis, including adrenal androgens."	0
197178	Several studies have shown significant subjective and objective improvement in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer who receive glucocorticoids.	0
197179	"Estrogens inhibit the release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, thus suppressing pituitary luteinizing hormone release and thereby reducing testicular production of testosterone."	0
197180	Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is no longer used at a dose of 5 mg/day in men with prostate cancer because of the increased risk of cardiovascular disease.	1
197181	"However, DES at a dose of 1 mg/day is useful in some patients."	0
197182	Other estrogen preparations and progesterones also may have a role in occasional patients.	0
197183	Sipuleucel-T is a dendritic cell vaccine that is prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained by leukapheresis.	0
197184	"These cells are exposed ex vivo to a novel recombinant protein immunogen, which consists of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) fused to human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor."	0
197185	These activated cells are then infused back into the patient approximately three days after the original harvesting.	1
197186	"In randomized trials, sipuleucel-T prolonged overall survival compared with placebo in men with minimally symptomatic, metastatic prostate cancer."	0
197187	There are no data on the effectiveness of sipuleucel-T in men whose only evidence of disease is an elevated PSA or in those with symptomatic metastatic disease.	0
197188	"Treatment is contraindicated in patients who are on steroids or opioids for cancer-related pain, and should be used with caution in patients with liver metastases."	1
197189	"Although sipuleucel-T prolonged overall survival, it did not significantly increase progression-free survival or affect the serum PSA."	0
197190	Thus assessing the impact of therapy on an individual patient can be difficult or impossible.	0
197191	Taxanes are the only cytotoxic chemotherapy agents that significantly prolonged overall survival in clinical trials in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer.	0
197192	Docetaxel (75 mg/m2 given every three weeks in combination with daily prednisone (5 mg twice a day) significantly prolonged overall survival compared with mitoxantrone plus prednisone in the TAX 327 phase III trial.	0
197193	"Based upon those results, docetaxel plus prednisone has become the standard initial regimen when chemotherapy is indicated for castrate resistant prostate cancer."	0
197194	Docetaxel causes significant myelosuppression and requires premedication to minimize the risk of infusion reactions.	0
197195	Therapy with prednisone is also required in combination with docetaxel.	0
197196	Contraindications include underlying hepatic dysfunction or compromised bone marrow function.	0
197197	Cabazitaxel is a synthetic taxane derivative developed to have activity in patients who progressed after treatment with docetaxel.	1
197198	"In a phase III trial, cabazitaxel plus prednisone significantly increased survival compared with mitoxantrone plus prednisone in men whose disease had progressed on docetaxel."	0
197199	Cabazitaxel can cause significant myelosuppression and requires premedication to minimize the risk of infusion reactions.	0
197200	Therapy with prednisone is also required in combination with docetaxel.	0
197201	Contraindications include underlying hepatic dysfunction or compromised bone marrow function.	0
197202	Mitoxantrone was the first chemotherapy agent approved for use in men with castrate resistant prostate cancer.	0
197203	"Mitoxantrone was approved based upon improvement in symptoms, and not a prolongation of survival."	0
197204	Its use now is restricted to patients requiring chemotherapy who have progressed on or are not candidates for taxane chemotherapy.	1
197205	Radium-223 is an alpha particle emitting radiopharmaceutical.	0
197206	"Radium is a bone-seeking element, and radium-223's radioactive decay allows the deposition of high energy radiation over a much shorter distance than with beta-emitting radioisotopes, thus minimizing toxicity to normal bone marrow and to other organs."	0
197207	"In a phase III trial, treatment with radium-223 was well tolerated, decreased skeletal related complications (pathologic fractures, epidural spinal cord compression, need for external beam radiation therapy), and significantly improved overall survival in patients with two or more bone metastases and no known visceral metastases."	1
197208	"Because of its mechanism of action, its use is limited to patients who have symptomatic bone metastases without other clinically significant sites of disease."	1
197209	Radium-223 is currently available only through an expanded access protocol for patients who have with symptomatic bone metastases who are not candidates for chemotherapy (NCT01516762).	1
197210	Surveillance strategies during treatment for disseminated prostate cancer are discussed separately.	0
197211	A variety of markers are being studied for their ability to identify subsets of patients with advanced prostate cancer who have significantly different prognosis.	1
197212	The most extensive data come from analyses of circulating tumor cells (CTCs);	0
197213	"more recently, studies have looked at gene expression profiles."	0
197214	"Ultimately, these different approaches may be combined."	0

197216	Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) producing PSA can be detected in the systemic circulation of men with prostate cancer.	0
197217	The impact of CTCs on prognosis was prospectively assessed using the CellSearch assay in the phase III trial comparing abiraterone plus prednisone with placebo plus prednisone in men with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer who had progressed on docetaxel chemotherapy.	0
197218	CTCs were measured in 972 of 1195 patients either at baseline and serially thereafter.	1
197219	Median overall survival was significantly longer in those with baseline CTCs <5 compared with those with CTCs >=5 (22.1 versus 10.9 months in those assigned to abiraterone and 19.7 versus 8.2 months in those assigned to placebo).	0
197220	"Among patients with a CTCs >=5 at baseline, significantly more patients treated with abiraterone had a decrease in CTC level to <5 compared with placebo (48 versus 17 percent at 12 weeks)."	1
197221	"Similarly, the level of CTCs was prognostic for overall survival in a second correlative study in 238 patients randomly assigned to treatment with docetaxel or docetaxel plus atrasentan."	1
197222	The significance of circulating prostate cancer cells in men at the time of their initial diagnosis is discussed elsewhere.	0
197223	Multiple studies have looked at the use of gene expression panels as a way to identify patient subsets with differing prognoses.	1
197224	"In one report, a six gene panel was initially developed in a group of 62 men with castrate resistant prostate cancer."	0
197225	The prognostic utility was then validated in an independent cohort of 138 patients.	0
197226	"The use of the panel was able to divide this cohort into low and high risk groups, with median survivals of 9.2 and 18.5 months, respectively."	0
197227	"In another study, a nine-gene was assessed in a two step process."	0
197228	A patient subset (LPD1) was identified from the initial study.	1
197229	"In the validation cohort, this panel found that those in this subset had a significantly poorer prognosis (median overall survival 11 versus 26 months)."	0
197230	"For patients with castrate resistant disease in whom small cell cancer is suspected, biopsy is indicated whenever possible."	1
197231	"If the biopsy confirms that the tumor is a small cell malignancy, chemotherapy with a small cell regimen is indicated."	0
197232	Osteoblastic metastases to the axial skeleton are the predominant site of metastases in most men with prostate cancer.	1
197233	"These lesions are frequently symptomatic and can cause pain, functional impairment, and debility."	0
197234	"The goals of treatment are to relieve pain, improve mobility, and prevent complications such as pathologic fractures or epidural spinal cord compression."	0
197235	"Systemic antitumor therapy may alleviate symptoms from bone metastases, but other treatments may also be needed."	0
197236	"External beam RT - External beam RT is indicated for men with either a single or a few focally symptomatic bone metastases, when pain cannot be controlled with moderate analgesics."	1
197237	"Local field RT provides some benefit in 80 to 90 percent of cases, and 50 to 60 percent have complete relief of symptoms."	0
197238	"Repeated use of palliative RT, especially when given to areas encompassing much of the active marrow, can cause bone marrow suppression, which may impair quality of life and limit the use of palliative chemotherapy."	0
197239	Radiopharmaceuticals - The alpha-particle emitting radiopharmaceutical radium-223 decreases bone pain and delays or prevents the complications of bone metastases.	0
197240	"The beta-particle emitting radioisotopes samarium-153 (153Sm) and strontium-89 (89Sr) have been used for palliative treatment of patients with multifocal, painful osteoblastic bone metastases and those with persistent or recurrent pain despite receiving external beam RT to maximal normal tissue tolerance."	1
197241	"However, the role of these agents is less clear with the development of alpharadin."	0
197242	"For men with bone metastases, the use of an osteoclast inhibitor (denosumab, zoledronic acid) is an important adjunct to reduce the risk of skeletal complications of bone metastases.(See."	1
197243	The presence of pain in men with advanced prostate cancer should prompt immediate and aggressive management with analgesics while local or systemic treatments that directly address the cause of the pain are pursued.	1
197244	"The use of nonopioid analgesics, opioids, and analgesic adjuvants is discussed elsewhere."	0
197245	Advanced prostate cancer can cause pelvic symptoms that significantly impair quality of life.	0
197246	"These include lower urinary tract symptoms, pelvic pain, hematuria, and obstructive rectal symptoms."	0
197247	Systemic therapy is the primary approach for the control of such symptoms.	0
197248	"Although there are no prospective clinical studies in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer, retrospective series indicate that RT may be useful for symptom palliation."	1
197249	"As an example, in one series 58 men were treated with 20 Gy in five fractions."	0
197250	"Four months after RT, 31 of 35 patients (89 percent) had complete resolution of symptoms."	1
197251	"In a second series, a more protracted RT schedule (2 Gy fractions, median dose 60 Gy) gave similar results."	0

197262	"Although most men with prostate cancer are diagnosed and successfully treated while disease is localized, some will present with or subsequently develop disseminated disease."	1
197263	This is often manifested initially by an increasing PSA in patients who are being closely followed for evidence of recurrence after definitive treatment.	1
197264	"In other cases, however, overt metastatic disease may be present when the patient is first diagnosed or at some time after definitive treatment for locoregional disease."	0
197265	The same treatment options are generally used for men with overt metastases and those whose only evidence of disease is an elevated or rising serum PSA.	0
197266	Previously untreated prostate cancer generally is dependent upon androgen for its continued growth.	0
197267	This observation provides the basis for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as the initial systemic therapy.	0
197268	Treatments targeting androgenic stimulation of the tumor are also used in several subsequent treatment modalities.	0
197269	We recommend initial treatment with either medical or surgical orchiectomy (androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]) to suppress serum testosterone levels for all patients requiring systemic therapy.	1
197270	"This approach replaced estrogen therapy, which was associated with increased cardiovascular toxicity in randomized trials."	0
197271	Other modalities that have been shown to prolong survival in men with castrate resistant disease have not been evaluated as initial therapy and are not indicated in this setting.	1
197272	"The optimal timing for therapeutic intervention depends upon the extent of disease as well as patient specific factors: For men with overt metastases, we suggest early treatment with ADT rather than delayed treatment."	0
197273	"This approach has been shown to delay prostate cancer related deaths, but has not been shown to improve overall survival."	0
197274	"For men whose only evidence of disseminated disease is an elevated or rising PSA following definitive locoregional therapy, the optimal timing for initiation of ADT is more problematic and involves a consideration of the prolonged natural history of the disease as well as patient specific factors including age and personal preferences."	0
197275	Castrate resistant prostate cancer is defined by the occurrence of disease progression after surgical or medical orchiectomy.	0
197276	The presence of castrate resistant disease does not imply that disease is totally independent of androgens and resistant to further therapies directed at blocking androgen stimulation.	0
197277	ADT should be continued when additional systemic therapy is used in men with castrate resistant disease.	0
197278	"For men with castrate resistant prostate cancer, we recommend that therapy sequentially incorporate modalities that have been demonstrated to improve overall survival, and the choice of therapy should be guided by the patient population studied in clinical trials."	0
197279	"Potential options include interference with androgenic stimulation of tumor growth ( abiraterone, enzalutamide), sipuleucel-T, taxane chemotherapy (docetaxel, cabazitaxel), and radium-223."	0
197280	"Older approaches that may have a role in selected cases include antiandrogens, antiandrogen withdrawal, suppression of adrenal steroidogenesis with ketoconazole or steroids, estrogens, and progesterones."	0
197281	"Factors that should be considered include the site and extent of disease, rate of disease progression, symptomatology, comorbidities, rate of disease progression, regulatory status and availability of the modality, side effects of the treatment, and contraindications."	0
197282	Osteoblastic lesions in the axial skeleton are the predominant site of metastases in the majority of cases.	0
197283	"For men with bone metastases, the use of an osteoclast inhibitor is an important adjunct to systemic therapy to reduce the risk of skeletal complications (pathologic fracture, epidural spinal cord compression)."	1
197284	"In addition, external beam radiation or radiopharmaceuticals may provide important symptom palliation for men with severe pain at one or more sites due to bone metastases."	0
198310	The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is directed toward the control of synovitis and the prevention of joint injury.	0
198311	"In patients whose condition is resistant to an initial course of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate, timely adjustments in the treatment regimens are required to achieve effective disease control and to prevent damage to the joints."	1
198312	"Support for an early aggressive approach to treatment is based upon the observations that joint damage, which may ultimately result in disability, begins early in the course of disease and that the longer that disease activity persists, the less likely the patient is to respond to therapy."	0
198313	Improved outcomes have resulted from the use of potent and well-tolerated nonbiologic (traditional) and biologic DMARDs used alone and in combination to induce and maintain tight control of disease.	0
198314	These medications and strategies have the potential to control synovitis and to slow or even stop radiographic progression.	0
198315	The treatment of active RA resistant to initial DMARD therapies in adults will be reviewed here.	0
198316	"The details of many of the clinical trials upon which this approach is based, the general principles of the management of RA, the initial treatment of RA, and the approach to RA patients with severe structural damage are presented separately."	1
198317	There are several general principles that are important in the management of all patients with RA.	1
198318	"Briefly, these include: Achievement and maintenance of tight control of disease activity, defined as remission or a state of low disease activity, without compromising safety."	0
198319	Treatment of all patients diagnosed with RA with DMARD therapy.	1
198320	"Use of antiinflammatory therapies, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids, to help control symptoms until DMARDs take effect."	0
198321	"Evaluation and ongoing care by an expert in the treatment of RA, typically a rheumatologist."	0
198322	These principles are discussed in detail elsewhere.	0
198323	It is important to determine whether joint symptoms in patients with persistently symptomatic RA are due to active inflammatory arthritis or are the result of structural damage that is unlikely to respond to antiinflammatory drugs and to nonbiologic or biologic DMARDs.	1
198324	Resistance to initial DMARD therapy is defined as one of the following: Failure to achieve remission or low disease activity within three to six months of initiating methotrexate (MTX) or other DMARD therapy in maximally tolerated doses within the usual therapeutic range.	0
198325	"A requirement, in addition to DMARDs, for chronic glucocorticoid therapy in a dose of greater than about 5 to 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent to achieve or maintain remission or low disease activity after three to six months of treatment with DMARDs."	0
198326	"A requirement for multiple courses with glucocorticoids, in excess of doses used for chronic therapy, for the treatment of recurrent disease flares in patients whose medication doses have been increased to the maximally tolerated or acceptable level."	1
198327	"Resistance or an inadequate response to subsequent DMARD therapy may be defined similarly, depending upon the treatment goals in an individual patient."	0
198328	"A number of nonpharmacologic measures and other medical interventions are important in the comprehensive management of RA, in addition to antiinflammatory and antirheumatic drug therapies."	0
198329	"These interventions, including patient education, vaccinations, and others, are discussed in detail elsewhere."	0
198330	"In patients resistant to initial therapy with DMARDs, we either add additional DMARDs or switch the patient to a different DMARD or DMARD combination, while also treating the active inflammation with antiinflammatory drug therapy."	1
198331	The choice of DMARD therapy in patients resistant to initial DMARD treatment depends largely upon the responses to the specific medications that have been used previously.	1
198332	"It is also influenced by patient preferences, especially for oral versus parenteral administration;"	0
198333	by regulatory or insurance limitations on drug choice;	0
198334	by comorbidities;	0
198335	and by cost to the patient.	0
198336	A choice among these agents is dependent upon the initial DMARD therapy and upon disease activity.	0
198337	"Briefly, we generally take the following approach: In patients treated for mildly active disease who have not responded adequately to initial therapy with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or sulfasalazine (SSZ) within three to six months, we add an alternative DMARD, usually methotrexate (MTX), or we administer ""triple therapy"" with HCQ, SSZ, and MTX."	1
198338	"In patients who have not achieved treatment goals after three to six months of MTX, we generally treat with MTX plus a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, particularly in patients with high levels of disease activity or with adverse prognostic features."	1
198339	Abatacept may be used as an alternative to a TNF inhibitor.	0
198340	Triple therapy is an acceptable alternative to MTX plus a TNF inhibitor.	0
198341	"In patients who do not achieve a satisfactory response with this combination within three to six months, we discontinue SSZ and HCQ and continue to administer MTX while adding a TNF inhibitor."	1
198342	"In patients who do not respond adequately to therapy with MTX plus an initial TNF inhibitor within three to six months, we generally switch to a different TNF inhibitor and continue therapy with MTX."	1
198343	"In patients who do not respond adequately to the therapies above, including MTX and trials of two TNF inhibitors, we use abatacept, tocilizumab, rituximab, or tofacitinib in place of the TNF inhibitor."	1
198344	"Importantly, we do NOT recommend combinations of biologic DMARDs, such as anakinra and a TNF inhibitor, or the combination of abatacept with either a TNF inhibitor or anakinra."	0
198345	"These regimens are associated with an increased frequency of severe adverse effects, particularly serious infections, compared with combinations of a nonbiologic and biologic DMARD."	0
198346	"A number of important precautions should be taken before using DMARDs, including laboratory assessment (complete blood count, serum creatinine, aminotransferases, and other studies as indicated), evaluation of comorbidities, vaccinations, and screening for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and latent tuberculosis infection."	0
198347	Precautions relevant to the use of each new agent being prescribed should be reviewed before initiating such therapy to confirm that all appropriate measures have been performed.	0
198348	A chest radiograph should be obtained prior to initiating treatment with methotrexate.	0
198349	These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.	0
198350	The approach to patients resistant to initial DMARD therapy depends upon the treatment the patient has already been given.	1
198351	"In patients with only mildly active disease when DMARDs were initiated, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or sulfasalazine (SSZ) may have been started, and the patient may not have received methotrexate (MTX)."	1
198352	"The next step at this point is starting MTX, either in place of or in addition to these agents."	0
198353	"In patients who have already been treated with MTX, combination therapy of MTX with a biologic DMARD or additional nonbiologic DMARDs is the next step."	1
198354	"In patients resistant to three to six months of therapy with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or sulfasalazine (SSZ)for initially mildly active disease, we suggest adding an alternative DMARD, usually methotrexate (MTX);"	1
198355	the approach in these patients is generally similar to that for patients with moderately to severely active disease presenting for initial DMARD therapy.	1
198356	"An acceptable alternative would be treatment with a combination of HCQ, SSZ, and MTX, termed ""triple therapy."""	0
198357	"A therapeutic trial of greater than three months is generally used in patients with partial responses showing progressive improvement, particularly in those in this group with low levels of disease activity and with limited functional impairment."	1
198358	We prefer MTX over alternative nonbiologic and biologic DMARDs in such patients for several reasons.	0
198359	"MTX typically serves as the ""anchor"" drug for the most commonly used DMARD combinations."	0
198360	"Randomized head-to-head trials have found that MTX has a faster onset of action, has comparable or greater efficacy, has better long-term tolerance, and improves survival, compared with other nonbiologic DMARD monotherapy."	0
198361	Direct comparisons of MTX with TNF inhibitor monotherapy have also shown comparable benefit.	0
198362	"Additionally, those patients with an inadequate response to MTX can be quickly identified and subsequently treated prior to the development of irreversible injury."	1
198363	"There is also some evidence that risk may be greater with biologic agents, and, frequently, there are regulatory or cost barriers to the use of biologic therapies in patients who have not been treated with MTX."	1
198364	"Treatment with MTX is reviewed in detail separately, and the efficacy of such ""triple therapy"" with this DMARD combination is discussed in further detail below."	0
198365	"In patients resistant to MTX after three to six months of treatment at optimal doses, we suggest either the combination of continued MTX plus a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor or the use of DMARD ""triple therapy"" with MTX plus sulfasalazine (SSZ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), rather than monotherapy with another nonbiologic or biologic DMARD."	1
198366	"In patients with partial responses showing progressive improvement, we may continue therapy with MTX for greater than three months before switching to one of these approaches, particularly in those with low to moderate levels of disease activity and with limited functional impairment."	1
198367	"Abatacept, the T-cell costimulation blocker, is an alternative to TNF inhibitors for use in combination with MTX in patients with an inadequate response to MTX, but its use in this setting is supported by a smaller body of evidence than that for TNF inhibitor use."	1
198368	It can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.	0
198369	Usual practice since TNF inhibitors came into clinical use beginning in the late 1990s has been to add a TNF inhibitor to MTX in patients with an inadequate response to MTX.	1
198370	"Abatacept and tocilizumab have each generally been used in practice only following inadequate responses to both MTX and TNF inhibitors, although both of these biologic agents are available for use in the US for patients who have not responded adequately to MTX alone;"	1
198371	"their respective efficacy in such patients is supported by evidence from randomized trials, which are described separately."	0
198372	"A further alternative for patients resistant to or unable to take MTX is leflunomide (LEF), an orally administered immunosuppressive agent, which may be used as monotherapy or in combination with either MTX or a TNF inhibitor."	1
198373	A number of treatment options are reasonable in patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) therapy.	1
198374	"The choice of drug combinations in such patients depends upon a combination of factors, including the level of disease activity, patient preference for route of administration, the presence of adverse prognostic features, and regulatory and cost barriers to drug access."	0
198375	"We prefer combination therapy with MTX plus a TNF inhibitor (eg, adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab), particularly in patients with high levels of disease activity or with adverse prognostic features."	1
198376	It may have a faster onset of action compared with DMARD triple therapy.	0
198377	"However, it requires subcutaneous injections or intravenous infusions, and regulatory or cost considerations may limit access."	0
198378	"We prefer triple therapy with MTX, sulfasalazine (SSZ), and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in patients for whom drug cost, regulatory restrictions on the use of biologic DMARDs, or preference for an oral agent that is not a biologic is an important factor."	1
198379	"In addition, concern regarding the risk of serious infections, the uncertain long-term increased risk of malignancy, and other possible adverse effects may influence clinician or patient preference for nonbiologic agents."	0
198380	"In those who do not achieve a satisfactory response with nonbiologic triple therapy within three to six months, we discontinue SSZ and HCQ and administer a TNF inhibitor with MTX."	0
198381	"Abatacept may be used as an alternative to a TNF inhibitor in patients in whom MTX plus a TNF inhibitor would otherwise be appropriate, particularly in patients unable to use a TNF inhibitor and in patients with a high level of disease activity."	1
198382	It may have a faster onset of action than triple therapy or leflunomide (LEF).	0
198383	"We generally prefer a TNF inhibitor over abatacept because the data supporting the use of abatacept are more limited than those available for the TNF inhibitors, although they suggest comparable benefit."	0
198384	"LEF may be of particular benefit for patients in whom regulatory or cost considerations preclude use of a biologic agent, despite failure of MTX to adequately control disease activity."	1
198385	"It can be used in place of MTX in those patients who do not tolerate MTX, or it can be used in combination with MTX instead of adding a biologic agent."	1
198386	It is also an option for patients who prefer not to use a parenterally administered drug.	1
198387	"In patients resistant to MTX, particularly those with high levels of disease activity or with adverse prognostic features, we prefer combination therapy with MTX plus a TNF inhibitor."	1
198388	"We usually use etanercept (50 mg administered subcutaneously once weekly) or adalimumab (40 mg administered subcutaneously every two weeks) as the initial TNF inhibitor in combination with continued MTX therapy, after appropriate pretreatment measures have been performed."	0
198389	An alternative TNF inhibitor in patients who prefer therapy by less frequent intravenous infusions is infliximab (usually 3 to 5 mg/kg every eight weeks).	1
198390	Other alternative TNF inhibitors include golimumab and certolizumab pegol.	0
198391	"In patients with an inadequate response to MTX, the use of combination therapy with the addition of a TNF inhibitor is supported by multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses that demonstrate the superiority of this approach compared with adding placebo while continuing the MTX."	1
198392	"The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 percent response (ACR20), ACR50, and ACR70 are composite measures reflecting at least 20, 50, and 70 percent improvement in several defined measurements of disease activity."	0
198393	"Trials of MTX plus a TNF inhibitor in patients who have not responded adequately to MTX alone typically result in ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates of about 60, 40, and 20 percent, respectively."	1
198394	"Indirect comparisons of the biologic agents in meta-analyses of randomized trials involving patients with an inadequate response to MTX have shown a statistically nonsignificant trend suggesting that TNF inhibitors may be more likely to result in an ACR50 response compared with other biologic agents (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95% CI 0.91-1.86)."	1
198395	"Meta-analyses and randomized trials have also shown that combination therapy of MTX with a biologic agent, such as a TNF inhibitor, is superior to biologic or traditional DMARD monotherapy in patients who are naive to DMARDs."	1
198396	"However, in patients who have had an inadequate response to MTX, most randomized trials have continued MTX while adding either a biologic or a placebo."	1
198397	A small number of randomized trials and retrospective studies have evaluated the relative benefits of adding a biologic agent to MTX compared with biologic monotherapy;	0
198398	"results range from showing small, statistically nonsignificant advantages for combination therapy to demonstrating substantial added benefit that is both statistically and clinically significant."	0
198399	Trials of biologic DMARDs and data supporting their use in patients with active RA are described in detail separately.	1
198400	The evidence comparing the efficacy and safety of MTX plus a TNF inhibitor in this setting with those of nonbiologic DMARD triple therapy and with those of MTX plus abatacept are described in detail below.	0
198401	There is no convincing evidence that any one of the TNF inhibitors has greater efficacy than the others.	0
198402	"The choice of TNF inhibitor depends upon regulatory or insurance restrictions on drug choice, upon safety issues, and upon patient preference for route and/or frequency of injection."	0
198403	Etanercept and adalimumab might be safer than infliximab.	0
198404	"However, comparisons between these agents are largely indirect;"	0
198405	"additionally, a case control study suggesting greater safety with etanercept, compared with infliximab or adalimumab, only addressed the risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis in patients who had not received adequate chemoprophylaxis prior to therapy."	1
198406	"Indirect comparisons of randomized trial results in a network meta-analysis suggested that patients receiving etanercept, adalimumab, or golimumab had statistically significantly lower rates of withdrawal from trials due to adverse effects compared with infliximab (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41-0.95; OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32-0.78; and OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30-0.99)."	1
198407	"TNF inhibitor therapy is generally well-tolerated, but these medications pose increased risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis and other granulomatous diseases (eg, histoplasmosis and coccidiomycosis) and of varicella zoster."	0
198408	"Adverse effects include injection-site reactions, infusion reactions, mildly reduced neutrophil counts and cytopenias, serious common and opportunistic infections, reactivation of hepatitis B, autoimmune phenomena including multiple sclerosis, and hepatotoxicity."	0
198409	"There is no proof of increased risk of malignancy with these agents in analyses of short-term randomized trial data, and results of a large population-based long-term study of patients with RA are encouraging."	1
198410	"However, further long-term studies are required."	0
198411	TNF inhibitors should not be administered to patients with active infections or with multiple sclerosis.	1
198412	The adverse effects of TNF inhibitor therapy are discussed in detail elsewhere.	0
198413	Two randomized trials have compared the combination of MTX plus a TNF inhibitor with DMARD triple therapy combining MTX plus sulfasalazine (SSZ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ);	0
198414	the trials found only small or no differences in clinical efficacy using composite measures of disease activity (ACR20 responses of approximately 35 to 50 percent after one or two years).	0
198415	"Radiographic outcomes only slightly favored TNF inhibitor use, but these differences did achieve statistical significance."	0
198416	Limitations in trial design and the use of different TNF inhibitors in the published reports preclude adequate direct comparisons of the regimens in the two trials.	0
198417	"Both trials included a step-up design, in which patients were randomly assigned (either before or after initial treatment with MTX) to receive one of the two treatment options following an inadequate response to MTX: Swefot trial - The Swedish Pharmacotherapy (Swefot) trial compared the efficacy of MTX plus infliximab with that of triple therapy using MTX, SSZ, and HCQ."	0
198418	This randomized but non-blinded trial involved 258 patients with RA of less than one year in duration who had not achieved low disease activity within three to four months of starting treatment with MTX alone (20 mg once weekly).	1
198419	"Differences between the groups were not significant at six or nine months, but, by one year (nine months after randomization and one year after initiating DMARD therapy with MTX alone), there was a significantly higher proportion of good responders (by the European League Against Rheumatism [EULAR] response criteria) among the group receiving infliximab (39 versus 25 percent, risk ratio [RR] 1.59, 95% CI 1.10-2.30)."	0

198433	Patients on MTX alone who had not reached the target of low disease activity at 24 weeks stepped up either to MTX plus etanercept or to triple therapy at that time.	1
198434	"Clinical outcomes, measured by the DAS28-ESR scores, were comparable during weeks 48 to 102 in patients receiving MTX plus etanercept or receiving triple therapy, regardless of whether they were initially assigned to immediate or step-up therapy."	1

198465	"Abatacept was comparable to other biologic agents, including several TNF inhibitors, rituximab, and tocilizumab."	0
198466	Evidence describing the benefits of abatacept compared with placebo in patients who have had an inadequate response to a TNF inhibitor is further reviewed below.	1
198467	Only a few trials have directly compared abatacept with another active DMARD.	0
198468	"These include two randomized trials described above, which have suggested comparable benefit of abatacept to TNF inhibitor therapy when either is used in combination with continued MTX in patients with an inadequate response to MTX therapy."	1
198469	The efficacy and safety of subcutaneous and intravenous administration of abatacept were comparable in a randomized trial involving 1457 patients with a previously inadequate response to methotrexate.	1
198470	"The efficacy of abatacept SC (125 mg SC on days one and eight, then weekly, plus an IV loading dose on day one of approximately 10 mg/kg) was comparable to abatacept IV (approximately 10 mg/kg IV on days 1, 15, and 29, then every four weeks) in achieving an ACR20 response after six months of treatment (both 76 percent)."	0

198480	"In patients with an inadequate response to MTX, some, but not all, experts advocate either switching to leflunomide (LEF) or adding LEF to ongoing MTX therapy."	1
198481	"The use of LEF alone, without MTX, is preferred in the absence of clinical improvement from prior treatment with the maximally tolerated dose of MTX within the usual therapeutic range, as well as in patients in whom there is a greater degree of concern for the possible increased risk of side effects with the combination of LEF and MTX."	1
198482	"Although both drugs are potentially hepatotoxic, the rationale for combined therapy is based upon their differing mechanisms of action."	0
198483	"In patients in whom LEF is used in place of MTX, the usual dose is 20 mg daily."	1
198484	"Reduced dosing with either LEF (10 instead of 20 mg daily) or MTX (eg, 15 mg instead of 20 to 25 mg weekly) should be used initially if the drugs are used in combination;"	0
198485	the dose is then increased incrementally no more frequently than monthly to usual maximal doses if it is required clinically and if there is no evidence of toxicity.	0
198486	"Some experts continue to use a loading dose of LEF (100 mg daily for the first three days of therapy) in patients given LEF monotherapy, but other experts avoid the use of a loading dose because of increased risk of frequent bowel movements and of diarrhea with this approach."	1
198487	The use of LEF in patients with RA is discussed in detail separately.	1
198488	"The efficacy of LEF was superior to placebo and was comparable to MTX in a systematic review of six randomized trials including comparisons of LEF with placebo and/or MTX, suggesting approximately twice the likelihood compared with placebo of achieving an ACR20 response at 6 or 12 months for either LEF or MTX."	0
198489	"In one trial involving 482 patients, for example, an ACR20 at one year was achieved in a similar proportion of patients on LEF or on MTX, and this rate was significantly higher than that seen with placebo (52 and 46 percent versus 26 percent)."	1
198490	"However, these trials have been criticized for using lower maximum doses of MTX (up to 15 mg/week) than those that have subsequently been commonly employed (up to 25 mg/week)."	0
198491	LEF had comparable efficacy to cyclosporine at 12 months of therapy in patients with an inadequate response to MTX (ACR50 of 40 versus 42 percent);	1
198492	"however, LEF has not been compared directly with other agents in such patients."	0
198493	"LEF has not been directly compared with the TNF inhibitors, but the superiority of TNF inhibitors is suggested by the comparability of LEF to sometimes suboptimal doses of MTX and to SSZ;"	0

198499	"At 24 weeks, the proportion of patients who met ACR20 criteria for improvement was significantly higher with LEF compared with placebo (46 versus 20 percent)."	1
198500	The combination was well-tolerated.	0
198501	"The rate of discontinuation and the incidence of adverse events, which were predominantly mild or moderate, were similar in the two groups."	0
198502	Diarrhea and elevation of serum aminotransferases were the only adverse effects seen significantly more often with LEF plus MTX than with placebo plus MTX.	0
198503	"Patients on both LEF and MTX may require closer monitoring (eg, monthly aminotransferase testing) for hepatotoxicity, given the increased risk of hepatotoxicity in some but not most studies, including reports of fatal liver failure."	1
198504	"Other adverse effects of LEF include diarrhea, alopecia, myelosuppression, hypertension, and rash."	0
198505	"In patients with an inadequate response to initial treatment with LEF alone, a TNF inhibitor may be added to LEF."	1
198506	An analysis of patients with RA in a large population database from Switzerland indicated that the addition of a TNF inhibitor was beneficial in patients with persistent disease activity on LEF alone.	1
198507	"However, randomized trials to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of LEF used together with a biologic DMARD have not been performed."	0
198508	"Disease activity and the response to therapy should be regularly reassessed, along with monitoring for drug toxicities, every four to eight weeks following a change in the treatment regimen until the patient is stable and until disease is under control."	0
198509	"Subsequently, assessments should not be less frequent than every three months."	0
198510	More frequent laboratory monitoring may be required depending upon the medications being used and following increases in dosing;	0
198511	more frequent clinical assessments may be required in patients experiencing a flare of disease or in those undergoing changes in therapy.	1
198512	"Well-controlled patients who are seen less frequently may require laboratory monitoring beyond that performed at scheduled visits and should be counseled, as should all patients, to contact their treating clinician if the arthritis flares."	1
198513	Laboratory testing for the monitoring of disease activity and for the monitoring and prevention of drug toxicity is discussed separately.	0
198514	"We periodically reevaluate disease activity using a quantitative composite measure at each assessment (eg, the Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI] or the Disease Activity Score [DAS] with 28 joint count [DAS28])."	0
198515	Patients who fail to achieve remission or low disease activity within three to six months of initiating therapy or who require more than 5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent glucocorticoid to maintain a state of remission should generally receive a more potent DMARD or combination of DMARDs.	1
198516	"A therapeutic trial of greater than three months is generally used in patients with partial responses showing progressive improvement, particularly in those with low to moderate levels of disease activity and with limited functional impairment."	1
198517	"In patients who do not respond adequately to therapy with an initial TNF inhibitor within three months, we suggest switching to a different TNF inhibitor and continuing therapy with MTX."	1
198518	"In such patients, we usually use one of the three more established TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab), rather than one of the newer agents with which there is less experience (golimumab or certolizumab pegol)."	0
198519	"An inadequate response to one anti-TNF agent does not predict resistance to other agents in this class, although inefficacy and discontinuation rates increase with successive switches."	0
198520	Some experts advocate switching to another class of biologic in patients who have experienced a serious adverse event (as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) with an initial TNF inhibitor.	1
198521	"The FDA definition of a serious adverse event includes an adverse event associated with the use of a medical product that resulted in a life-threatening event, in hospitalization, prolongation of a hospitalization, in disability or permanent damage, in a congenital anomaly or birth defect in a child of a parent using the medication, or in an adverse event requiring intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage."	1
198522	"Limited randomized trials, several large registry-based studies, and case series have demonstrated the benefit of switching from one biologic DMARD to another, if inefficacy or toxicity limits the use of a given agent."	0
198523	The best data illustrating that switching to a second TNF inhibitor after discontinuation of a first is effective are from a randomized trial of golimumab as the second agent.	0
198524	"There is more limited clinical experience with golimumab than with several of the other TNF inhibitors, and its role relative to other TNF inhibitors in RA treatment remains to be better defined."	0
198525	"In this trial, 461 patients with active RA despite prior use of at least one TNF inhibitor were randomly assigned to golimumab or placebo while continuing stable doses of baseline nonbiologic DMARDs (MTX, SSZ, and/or HCQ), glucocorticoids, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs."	1
198526	"The prior TNF inhibitor could have been discontinued due either to ineffectiveness (58 percent) or to other factors unrelated to effectiveness, including intolerance or inaccessibility (53 percent);"	0
198527	some discontinued the first TNF inhibitor for multiple reasons.	0
198528	"Among those who had discontinued the first TNF inhibitor due to lack of effectiveness, patients in the combined golimumab group (who received either 50 or 100 mg every four weeks) were significantly more likely to achieve an ACR20 or higher response at week 14 (39 versus 18 percent)."	1
198529	Patients who discontinued the first drug for reasons other than ineffectiveness were also more likely to achieve at least an ACR20 response with golimumab (34 versus 20 percent).	1
198530	There was no increase in serious adverse events in patients on golimumab compared with those on placebo.	1

198537	"In patients who do not respond adequately to three- to six-month trials of the therapies above, including trials of MTX and trials of two TNF inhibitors, or who are unable to take a TNF inhibitor, we suggest the use of abatacept, tocilizumab, or rituximab, biologic agents which may all be effective in patients who have not responded adequately to MTX plus a TNF inhibitor."	1
198538	"Tofacitinib, the orally administered kinase inhibitor available for use in the US, is also an alternative in this setting, although there is very limited experience with this agent, and its role will be better defined over time with wider use and further study."	0
198539	"Because the likelihood of a response decreases with second switches of TNF inhibitors, a change to a biologic DMARD other than a TNF inhibitor is suggested after the failure of two such agents."	0
198540	There are no randomized trials that have evaluated this hypothesis.	0
198541	"In patients who discontinue the second TNF inhibitor, analyses of data from a large national patient registry in Great Britain suggested that discontinuation was primarily due to the same reason for which the first drug was stopped (inefficacy or toxicity)."	1
198542	"The choice between abatacept, tocilizumab, rituximab, and tofacitinib depends upon several factors, which vary in importance in different patients."	0
198543	These factors include patient preference;	0
198544	"regulatory, insurance, and cost limitations;"	0
198545	comorbidities;	0
198546	and clinician experience.	0
198547	"They have not been directly compared, but abatacept, tocilizumab, and rituximab appear comparable in indirect comparisons of randomized trial data in a meta-analysis."	0
198548	We generally take the following approach: We usually use either abatacept or tocilizumab as the first choice in this group of patients.	0
198549	"In patients who experience adverse effects from these agents, the immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory actions of these drugs are more rapidly reversed than those of rituximab, whose effects may last for several months or longer."	1
198550	"Additionally, rituximab use may be very rarely associated with devastating illness due to reactivation of the polyomavirus JC (JC virus), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)."	0
198551	"In older patients with more comorbidities, we prefer abatacept over tocilizumab."	1
198552	"There is more limited experience with tocilizumab than with abatacept or rituximab, and some concerns remain regarding potential toxicity."	0
198553	Indirect comparisons suggest that abatacept may have fewer adverse effects than the other biologic agents used in RA.	0
198554	"Rituximab may be preferred in patients in whom monthly drug administration may be problematic, as a treatment course of two IV infusions is administered no more frequently than every six months."	1
198555	Patients with rheumatoid factor or with anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies may have a greater response to the drug than seronegative patients.	1
198556	"Otherwise, the efficacy and safety of rituximab in patients with RA appear similar to those of other biologic agents."	1
198557	The relative role of tofacitinib in patients who have had an inadequate response to other DMARDs is unclear.	1
198558	"A potential advantage of this medication is that it is administered orally, but data regarding the risk of adverse events and outcomes with this drug compared with other antirheumatic medications are more limited compared with what is known regarding other available agents."	0
198559	"We prefer these agents over anakinra, as they all appear more effective than anakinra, based upon their comparability to biologic DMARDs that have been shown superior to anakinra in indirect comparisons."	0

198580	"Similarly, we generally wait six months after administration of rituximab before switching to an alternative medication for lack of efficacy or for adverse effects because of the duration of its biologic effects."	0
198581	Rituximab is given in combination with ongoing MTX treatment.	0
198582	The efficacy of rituximab plus continued therapy with MTX in patients with an inadequate response to a TNF inhibitor was shown in comparison with placebo plus continued MTX in a randomized trial involving 520 patients.	1
198583	"At six months, significantly more patients receiving rituximab showed at least 20 percent improvement in clinical activity compared with placebo treated patients (ACR20 of 51 versus 18 percent)."	1
198584	Additional evidence suggests benefit with retreatment six months after an initial course.	0
198585	"Additionally, a registry-based study suggested that, when the reason for stopping a TNF inhibitor was lack of effect rather than an adverse event, rituximab resulted in a greater decrease in disease activity compared with treatment with another TNF inhibitor (DAS28 decrease of -1.34 versus -0.93)."	0
198586	"The use of rituximab in the treatment of RA, additional evidence supporting such use, and the adverse effects of rituximab are reviewed in detail separately."	0
198587	Tofacitinib is an orally administered Janus kinase (JAK kinase) inhibitor that decreases signalling by a number of cytokine and growth factor receptors.	0
198588	It is taken in a dose of 5 mg twice daily.	0
198589	"Tofacitinib can be used as monotherapy or combined with MTX or other nonbiologic DMARDs in patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to MTX, but it should not be taken in combination with biologic agents or with other potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine or cyclosporine."	1
198590	The evidence supporting the use of tofacitinib in patients with RA is reviewed here briefly and is discussed in more detail separately.	1
198591	The efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis have been evaluated in several trials in patients with an inadequate response to MTX or another traditional or biologic DMARD.	1
198592	"In a randomized trial involving 611 patients with an inadequate response to at least one nonbiologic or biologic DMARD, tofacitinib monotherapy (5 mg twice daily) resulted significantly more often in reductions in signs and symptoms of active RA after three months of treatment, compared with placebo (ACR20 of 60 versus 27 percent)."	1
198593	"In a randomized trial involving 717 patients, tofacitinib (5 mg twice daily) and adalimumab (40 mg administered subcutaneously every two weeks) showed similarly significant benefit compared with placebo after six months in patients with active RA who had had an inadequate response to MTX and who continued MTX cotherapy (ACR20 of 52 and 47 percent versus 28 percent, respectively)."	1
198594	"The relative safety of tofacitinib appeared similar to that of biologic DMARDs, including increased risk of infections and liver function test abnormalities;"	0
198595	"additional concerns that require attention in clinical use include neutropenia, hyperlipidemia, and, possibly, increased serum creatinine."	0
198596	Gastrointestinal perforations have also been reported.	0
198597	The need for concurrent MTX therapy with use of tofacitinib is uncertain and requires further study.	0
198598	"There are several options in patients who are unable to take or who have an inadequate response to TNF inhibitors, abatacept, tocilizumab, rituximab, and tofacitinib."	1
198599	"The choice between these further options depends upon patient preferences regarding route of administration, patient comorbidities, and clinician preference based upon degree of experience with a given agent."	0
198600	There have been no head-to-head comparisons of these therapies.	0
198601	"Nonbiologic (traditional) DMARDs - Treatment options in this setting should include the use of nonbiologic DMARDs, such as leflunomide, or DMARD combinations, such as triple therapy, which were not used in the original sequence of drug regimens in a given patient."	0
198602	"These agents may be tried before less effective biologic agents, such as anakinra, or before the other nonbiologic DMARDs used infrequently in practice, such as those mentioned below."	0
198603	"Anakinra - The interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, can be used in combination with MTX but appears less effective than other biologic DMARDs in RA."	0
198604	Its effectiveness in patients who have failed to respond to MTX plus a TNF inhibitor has not been evaluated.	1
198605	"Other nonbiologic traditional DMARDs - Nonbiologic DMARDs that have less efficacy, greater toxicity, or both, compared with other available medications, but that may be of use in patients without other treatment options include: Azathioprine."	1

198608	"Antiinflammatory drugs are used as a supplement to DMARDs under several conditions, including as bridging therapies until newly instituted DMARD regimens become effective, as adjuncts to DMARDs on a chronic basis, and for the management of disease exacerbations (flares)."	0
198609	Analgesic effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen may also give additional relief.	0
198610	"We use NSAIDs or systemic and/or intraarticular glucocorticoids when needed for ongoing control of inflammation, while awaiting the response to modifications in DMARD therapy."	0
198611	Glucocorticoids can help to rapidly control inflammation and to improve symptoms.	0
198612	"However, they should be used in the lowest dose required once such control is achieved, and they should be tapered and discontinued as soon as feasible."	0
198613	Some patients require ongoing therapy with low doses of glucocorticoids to maintain remission or a low level of disease activity.	0
198614	RA has natural exacerbations (also known as flares) and reductions of continuing disease activity.	0
198615	"It is important to distinguish a disease flare, characterized by symptoms and by physical and laboratory findings of increased inflammatory synovitis, from noninflammatory causes of local or generalized increased pain."	0
198616	The severity of the flare and background drug therapy influence the choice of therapies.	0
198617	The treatment of such flares is described in detail elsewhere.	0
198618	"In addition to the medications noted above, including NSAIDs, which also have analgesic effects, we use other analgesic medications, such as acetaminophen and/or tramadol, for additional pain relief, if required."	0
198619	We generally avoid the use of potent opioids because pain can be controlled in most patients with RA by effective use of antiinflammatories and DMARDs that control the disease process.	1
198620	"Patients without evidence of very significant joint injury who appear to require opioids for adequate pain relief should be evaluated for fibromyalgia or other comorbid causes of pain (eg, fracture, tumor, spinal disorders, or others)."	1
198621	"Most patients with early, severely active RA require sustained therapy and adjustments in their treatment regimen over months to years to achieve treatment goals."	1
198622	"In the minority of patients who achieve a sustained clinical remission of greater than one year, we cautiously try to reduce nonbiologic and biologic DMARD doses while maintaining close monitoring to facilitate recognition of any recurrence of disease activity."	1
198623	"However, we generally avoid discontinuing all DMARD treatment."	0
198624	"Although some patients may tolerate a reduced dose of medications, the decision to discontinue DMARDs in patients in remission remains controversial, and there is limited evidence regarding tapering of DMARDs in patients who are started on DMARDs early in their disease course or who have been treated with biologic DMARDs."	1
198625	Our approach is based upon the available data and upon our clinical experience.	0
198626	"As an example of our approach, in a patient in clinical remission being treated with prednisone (7 mg/day), MTX (20 mg/week), and etanercept (50 mg/week), we would first try to reduce prednisone because of the risk of long-term adverse effects with glucocorticoids."	1
198627	"In such a patient, we would lower the glucocorticoid dose slowly (no faster than 1 mg every two to four weeks), as long as there was no recurrence of disease activity."	0
198628	"If prednisone can be discontinued or if it cannot be completely eliminated but can be lowered to a dose no greater than 5 mg/day, we would then reduce the dosing of the TNF inhibitor, based upon our clinical experience."	0
198629	"We try to reduce etanercept by slowly decreasing the dosing frequency (eg, to every 10 to 14 days, then gradually to every three to four weeks if dose reduction is tolerated)."	0
198630	"In patients on infliximab, in whom dose adjustment is more feasible compared with etanercept or adalimumab, we would try to incrementally reduce the dose to as low as 3 mg/kg and to increase the interval between infusions to every eight weeks."	1
198631	"In patients who are able to discontinue a biologic and who then remain in remission for at least a year, we next decrease MTX."	1
198632	We reduce the MTX dose in 2.5 mg increments every two to three months as tolerated but generally to no lower than 15 mg/week.	0
198633	Continued close monitoring is required in patients who discontinue or reduce any of their medications.	1
198634	"The risk of disease recurrence in such patients is high, and flares of disease may occur even several years after stopping therapy."	0
198635	"Additionally, clinical remission can be difficult to achieve upon resumption of DMARD therapy in patients who have discontinued all DMARDs."	1
198636	"The best candidates for achieving a drug-free remission appear to be patients who have a short duration of symptoms when treatment is started, patients who are of the male sex, patients who have an absence of autoantibodies, and patients who receive early intensive therapy."	1
198637	"The effects on the progression of joint injury of less frequent dosing (eg, based upon symptomatic need only) have not been evaluated."	0

198649	"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) benefit from the achievement and maintenance of tight control of disease activity, with the ideal goal of remission."	1
198650	"Whenever possible, antiinflammatory agents, including glucocorticoids, should be used only as adjunctive agents."	0
198651	"Patient education and other nonpharmacologic and preventive therapies, including appropriate immunizations, are needed for all patients with RA."	0
198652	"In patients with RA, resistance to initial therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is defined as failure to achieve remission or low disease activity within three to six months despite the use of maximally tolerated doses within the usual therapeutic range;"	1
198653	"as a requirement, in addition to DMARDs, for excessively high doses of glucocorticoids;"	0
198654	"or as recurrent flares of disease requiring multiple courses of glucocorticoids with doses in excess of those acceptable for chronic therapy, despite maximally tolerated or acceptable doses of the DMARDs being used."	0
198655	"In patients with active RA resistant to initial therapy after three to six months of treatment, we recommend treatment with a different or additional DMARD or with DMARD combinations to achieve control of signs and symptoms of disease, rather than continuing the initial DMARD regimen."	1
198656	"The choice of drug combinations in such patients depends upon prior therapy, upon the level of disease activity, upon patient preference for route of administration, upon the presence of adverse prognostic features, and upon regulatory and cost barriers to drug access."	0
198657	"In patients resistant to initial therapy with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or sulfasalazine (SSZ), we suggest adding methotrexate (MTX) or treating with a combination of HCQ, SSZ, and MTX, rather than switching to a TNF inhibitor or to a TNF inhibitor plus MTX."	1
198658	"Usual doses of these medications are MTX (up to 25 mg once weekly administered orally or parenterally), HCQ (400 mg daily taken orally), and SSZ (1000 mg twice daily taken orally)."	0
198659	"In patients who have not achieved treatment goals after three to six months of MTX at optimal doses, we suggest either the combination of continued MTX plus a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor (eg, etanercept or adalimumab) or the use of DMARD ""triple therapy"" with MTX plus SSZ and HCQ, rather than monotherapy with another nonbiologic or biologic DMARD."	1
198660	Usual doses of these TNF inhibitors are etanercept (50 mg subcutaneously once weekly) and adalimumab (40 mg subcutaneously every two weeks).	0
198661	We use triple therapy in patients for whom drug cost and preference for an oral agent are important factors.	1
198662	"In patients in whom MTX plus a TNF inhibitor would otherwise be appropriate but who are unable to use a TNF inhibitor, we suggest the combination of MTX plus abatacept, rather than biologic monotherapy or another DMARD combination."	1
198663	Abatacept may be administered either intravenously (usually 750 mg once every four weeks) or subcutaneously (125 mg once weekly).	0
198664	"In patients in whom regulatory or cost considerations preclude use of a biologic agent despite failure of MTX or DMARD triple therapy to adequately control disease activity, we suggest the use of leflunomide (LEF) rather than alternative nonbiologic DMARDs (eg, gold, azathioprine, or cyclosporine. In patients whose treatment regimen has changed, reevaluation may be required up to every four weeks for the effectiveness of therapy and for the monitoring of possible drug toxicity. We assess and monitor disease activity using a quantitative composite measure at each assessment. Further management is dependent upon disease response. In patients who do not respond adequately to therapy with an initial TNF inhibitor within three to six months, we suggest switching to a different TNF inhibitor, rather than to another class of biologic.

198671	"We continue nonbiologic and biologic DMARD therapy at reduced doses, if possible, for patients in remission, rather than discontinuing treatment with DMARDs."	1
198672	"In patients experiencing a disease flare that is not controlled with NSAIDs, we suggest treatment with intraarticular or oral glucocorticoids rather than switching or continuing NSAIDs as the only additional agent."	0
198673	"We use antiinflammatory drug therapy, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids, on a temporary basis to quickly achieve control of signs and symptoms of disease, and we then taper and withdraw these medications once a new DMARD regimen has taken effect."	0
198674	"Some patients benefit from chronic low-dose glucocorticoid therapy (eg, prednisone to 5 to 7.5 mg daily)."	0
198675	The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is directed toward the control of synovitis and the prevention of joint injury.	0
198676	"Support for an early aggressive approach to treatment is based upon the observations that joint damage, which may ultimately result in disability, begins early in the course of disease and that, the longer active disease persists, the less likely the patient is to respond to therapy."	0
198677	Improved outcomes have resulted from the use of potent and well-tolerated nonbiologic (traditional) and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) used alone and in combination to induce and maintain tight control of disease.	0
198678	These medications and strategies have the potential to control synovitis and to slow or stop radiographic progression.	0
198679	"These observations regarding the course of disease and the efficacy of current therapeutic approaches, coupled with limits in the ability to accurately identify individuals with a poor prognosis, support our view that every patient with established active RA should be treated with DMARDs at the earliest stage of disease, ideally within three months of symptom onset."	1

198696	"These interventions, including patient education, vaccinations, and others, are discussed in detail elsewhere."	0
198697	"Our approach to therapy is based upon the widely favored view that all patients diagnosed with RA should receive DMARDs to prevent, arrest, or retard disease-related injury, as described above."	1
198698	"Recommendations of major groups support the early use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), usually methotrexate (MTX), for most patients with active disease."	1
198699	"In some patients with mild disease, particularly those with minimal or low levels of disease activity, we use hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine, as described elsewhere."	1
198700	The following is our general approach to the selection of drug therapies for the initial therapy of patients with moderately to severely active RA.	1
198701	It is broadly consistent with the 2008 and 2012 American College of Rheumatology recommendations and with the 2010 recommendations of the European League Against Rheumatism.	0
198702	We initiate therapy with a DMARD or combinations of DMARDs.	0
198703	We suggest MTX as the initial DMARD.	0
198704	"In patients unable to take MTX, we use monotherapy with a TNF inhibitor (eg, etanercept or adalimumab), leflunomide, or sulfasalazine."	1
198705	"We add nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or glucocorticoids (systemic and/or intraarticular) for initial symptomatic control of inflammation, while awaiting the response to DMARD therapy."	0
198706	We do not use these NSAIDs or glucocorticoids as the sole or primary treatments.	0
198707	"If the response to appropriate doses of MTX monotherapy is inadequate after three to six months or if there are persistently high levels of disease activity on MTX alone, our preferred approach is to initiate combination therapy."	0
198708	"We initially use one of the more effective disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), usually methotrexate, both to suppress synovitis and other signs and symptoms of active disease and to prevent articular bone erosions and joint space narrowing."	0
198709	We initiate DMARD therapy early in the treatment of RA because delayed use of such medications results in poorer physical function and in increased joint injury.	0
198710	"Numerous meta-analyses and randomized, controlled trials support the use of nonbiologic (traditional) and biologic DMARDs in patients with active RA."	1
198711	These trials included a mix of patients with moderate and severely active disease and a mean duration of illness of 6 to 12 months.	1
198712	The applicability of these studies to the initial treatment of patients with active disease is addressed together with the other evidence described below.	1
198713	"We take a number of important precautions before using DMARDs, including laboratory assessment (complete blood count, serum creatinine, aminotransferases, and other studies as indicated), evaluation of comorbidities, vaccinations, and screening for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and latent tuberculosis infection."	0
198714	A chest radiograph should be obtained prior to initiating treatment with methotrexate.	0
198715	These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.	0
198716	We recommend methotrexate (MTX) as the DMARD of choice for the initial treatment of patients with moderately to severely active RA.	1
198717	"MTX typically serves as the ""anchor"" drug for the most commonly used DMARD combinations."	0
198718	The major issues regarding the use of MTX in RA will be briefly reviewed here but are discussed in further detail elsewhere.	0
198719	MTX is contraindicated in several groups of patients.	0
198720	These include: Women who are contemplating becoming pregnant.	1
198721	Women who are pregnant.	1
198722	Patients with liver disease or excessive alcohol intake.	1
198723	Patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min).	1
198724	"Male partners of women contemplating becoming pregnant should exercise caution regarding the use of MTX for three months prior to conception, if possible, given the very limited data regarding evidence of risk in this setting."	1
198725	"Methotrexate (MTX) is given in a single weekly dose, usually orally."	0
198726	The optimal starting dose and schedule for dose escalation are uncertain.	0
198727	"We suggest initiating therapy at a dose between 7.5 and 15 mg once weekly for most patients, depending upon the degree of disease activity, the size and age of the patient, the presence of comorbidities, and renal function."	1
198728	"As examples, we would treat a 70-year-old patient weighing 55 kg with moderately active disease with an initial dose of 7.5 mg once weekly, while an otherwise healthy 30-year-old patient weighing 80 kg with highly active disease would be started on 15 mg once weekly."	1
198729	"A lower initial dose is essential in patients with reduced renal function, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min."	1
198730	The MTX dose is increased as tolerated and as needed to control symptoms and signs of arthritis.	0
198731	Our usual approach is to increase the dose after four weeks at a rate of 2.5 mg (one tablet) per week as indicated by disease activity and as tolerated.	0
198732	"In patients with continued high disease activity, we may increase by up to 5 mg/week, if few comorbidities are present and if the increase in the dose continues to be well-tolerated."	1
198733	The usual target dose is at least 15 mg/week;	0
198734	the usual maximum dose is 25 mg/week.	0
198735	Alternative dose titration strategies may also be employed.	0
198736	"In early RA trials in which the dose of MTX is rapidly increased to 20 mg/week and in which the drug is continued for at least three months, approximately 30 percent of patients achieve a DAS28 less than or equal to 3.2, consistent with low disease activity, within three to six months."	0
198737	"For patients in whom 20 to 25 mg of MTX orally once weekly is ineffective or is poorly tolerated because of gastrointestinal symptoms, a trial of subcutaneous MTX administration is an alternative to switching to another DMARD or to adding a TNF inhibitor."	1
198738	"Alternatively, MTX is better absorbed, particularly at doses of 15 mg/week or greater, if the dose is split into two doses on the day of administration."	0
198739	"It is imperative to tell the patient to take all the MTX over a single 24-hour period once a week, as spreading the dose out further may produce significant liver toxicity."	0
198740	"MTX treatment requires meticulous monitoring for bone marrow, liver, and lung toxicity."	0
198741	The toxicities associated with MTX in the doses used in RA are very rarely life-threatening in patients receiving recommended monitoring.	1
198742	"MTX is generally well-tolerated, although most patients experience at least one or more of the more common side effects, such as gastrointestinal upset or stomatitis, over their course of therapy."	0
198743	"MTX is discontinued due to adverse effects after two and five years of treatment in up to 20 and 35 percent of patients, respectively."	0
198744	The major side effects of low-dose MTX are discussed in detail elsewhere.	0
198745	Patients receiving MTX should also receive daily supplementation with folic acid.	1
198746	The use of folic acid and additional considerations with the use of MTX that are discussed in more detail separately include alcohol ingestion and dosing in renal insufficiency.	0
198747	"Randomized head-to-head trials have found that MTX has a faster onset of action, comparable or greater efficacy, and better long-term tolerance, compared with other nonbiologic DMARD monotherapy."	0
198748	MTX has also been shown to improve survival (both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality) in patients with RA compared with other nonbiologic DMARDs.	1
198749	"However, practically all trials that originally led to the widespread use of MTX in this role were performed in patients with well-established RA, often after several years of disease, rather than soon after the initial development of inflammatory arthritis."	1
198750	"In addition, these trials used lower doses than are typically used at present."	0
198751	"Despite this, we feel that these relative benefits with MTX extend to those with early active RA."	0
198752	"In randomized trials, initial therapy with MTX results in comparable benefit to initial therapy with a TNF inhibitor alone."	0
198753	Approaches using tight control treatment strategies have shown significant benefit without the use of biologics for initial therapy.	0
198754	"Combinations of MTX with either sulfasalazine (SSZ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), with both SSZ and HCQ, or with a biologic DMARD also have proven efficacy for initial treatment of highly active RA in patients with poor prognostic features."	1
198755	"However, we prefer MTX monotherapy for initial treatment rather than in combination with other nonbiologic or biologic DMARDs or a biologic DMARD alone, despite the fact that a greater proportion of patients respond well when treated initially with combination therapies or biologics."	0
198756	"This is principally because: Initial MTX monotherapy is adequate in many patients with early, moderately to severely active RA;"	1
198757	those with an inadequate response can be quickly identified and subsequently treated with combination therapy prior to the development of irreversible injury.	0
198758	"Clinical outcomes after several years of treatment are similar in trials that compared patients initially receiving MTX, who then stepped up to combination therapy after an inadequate response, with patients initially treated with combination therapy."	1
198759	Long-term clinical outcomes between such groups are not well-studied.	0
198760	"However, radiographic differences at two years in such trials, while favoring the initial combination groups, have been very small, and their clinical significance remains to be determined."	0
198761	"Compared with MTX, there is less information available regarding the long-term safety of biologic DMARDs, and there is some evidence that the risk may be greater with these agents."	0
198762	"There are also widespread regulatory or cost barriers to the use of biologic therapies for initial DMARD treatment for most DMARD-naive patients, even with severely active RA."	1
198763	There are insufficient data to identify the optimal initial therapy in patients with moderately to severely active RA who are unable to take MTX.	1
198764	"The choice of agent is largely based upon indirect comparisons, limited head-to-head comparisons, regulatory or insurance requirements, and patient preferences regarding relative risks and benefits, route of administration, and cost."	0
198765	"The principal options are a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, leflunomide (LEF), or sulfasalazine (SSZ): For patients who are not restricted by regulatory or cost constraints, we suggest the use of a TNF inhibitor."	1
198766	"Among the available agents, etanercept is our first choice, followed by adalimumab."	0
198767	"In patients who prefer an orally administered or less costly agent, we suggest the use of leflunomide or sulfasalazine."	1
198768	"Data from randomized trials demonstrating the benefit of each agent compared with placebo, as well as head-to-head comparisons of MTX with TNF inhibitors and of MTX, LEF, and SSZ with each other, are reviewed in detail elsewhere."	0
198769	"A number of biologic DMARDs, particularly the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors, have been proven effective as monotherapy, compared with placebo or MTX, in randomized trials in patients with moderately and severely active RA."	1
198770	"Although the biologic DMARDs have not been directly compared with each other, indirect analyses are available."	0
198771	"In the patient who is unable to take methotrexate (MTX), we use either of the following TNF inhibitors for initial therapy: Etanercept - Etanercept has shown generally similar or modestly greater efficacy compared with MTX in randomized trials."	1
198772	"There is slightly longer experience with this agent, and there is indirect evidence of lower rates of serious infections compared with other biologic DMARDs, including adalimumab and infliximab."	0
198773	"In our experience, benefit is also reached more quickly with etanercept and other TNF inhibitors than with most nonbiologic DMARDs, including MTX, leflunomide, and sulfasalazine."	0
198774	The data demonstrating the efficacy of etanercept are presented separately.	0
198775	Adalimumab - Adalimumab is also effective in this group of patients;	0
198776	"it can be administered as an every other week injection, which some patients prefer to a weekly injection."	1
198777	The use of adalimumab is supported by randomized trials showing comparable efficacy to MTX as initial DMARD monotherapy and by indirect comparisons in a meta-analysis of randomized trials showing comparable efficacy to other TNF inhibitors.	0
198778	"The newer TNF inhibitors, certolizumab pegol and golimumab, are also effective as monotherapy, but there is less long-term experience with these newer medications."	0
198779	"As a result, we generally prefer other alternatives."	0
198780	Use of infliximab alone is generally NOT recommended due to the increased likelihood of developing inactivating human antichimeric antibodies (HACA) when this chimeric monoclonal antibody is given without other immunosuppressive drugs.	0
198781	"However, we recognize that, in clinical practice, some patients receive infliximab alone."	0
198782	"Loss of efficacy due to emergence of HACA may be overcome by use of increasing doses or by increased frequency of administration of infliximab, although the increased cost associated with this approach may be prohibitive."	0
198783	Adverse effects of TNF inhibitors are discussed in detail elsewhere.	0
198784	The rates of toxicity requiring drug withdrawal in practice are not well-established.	0
198785	"In one study of a cohort of 6739 patients with RA receiving new treatment with a TNF inhibitor, 15 percent of patients stopped their drug due to toxicity after a mean follow-up of 15 months."	1
198786	Results from patients in randomized trials are even lower but are difficult to generalize to patients being seen in practice or receiving treatment for more than one or two years.	1
198787	"In patients unable to take methotrexate (MTX), effective nonbiologic alternatives for initial therapy include leflunomide (LEF) and, in some patients, sulfasalazine (SSZ): Leflunomide - We use leflunomide (LEF) in patients who, for regulatory, insurance, or cost reasons, are unable to use MTX or a biologic DMARD for initial treatment."	1
198788	We may also use LEF in patients who have a strong preference for an oral rather than a parenteral agent.	1
198789	"The efficacy of LEF was comparable to MTX and superior to placebo in a meta-analysis and in randomized trials comparing these agents, but these trials have been criticized for using lower maximum doses of MTX (up to 15 mg/week) than have subsequently been commonly employed (up to 25 mg/week)."	0
198790	"LEF has not been directly compared with the TNF inhibitors, but the superiority of TNF inhibitors is suggested by the comparability of LEF to sometimes suboptimal doses of MTX and to SSZ;"	0
198791	by the more rapid effects and greater overall benefit of TNF inhibitors when they have been directly compared with MTX or SSZ;	0
198792	and by clinical experience.	0
198793	The supporting data are presented separately.	0
198794	"Among nonbiologic DMARDs, we prefer LEF over SSZ because of its possible greater effectiveness for the treatment of severely active RA, regardless of the presence or absence of poor prognostic factors."	0
198795	"Some randomized trials suggest that LEF is more effective than SSZ in achieving a clinical response, in decreasing functional disability, and in reducing progression of erosive changes;"	0
198796	others indicate comparable efficacy of the two agents.	0
198797	"Additionally, the adverse effect profile of LEF is generally similar to that of MTX, with similar rates of withdrawal for drug toxicity at two years."	0
198798	The drug should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency.	1
198799	The data that support the efficacy of LEF in the treatment of RA are reviewed elsewhere.	0
198800	"Sulfasalazine - We limit the use of sulfasalazine (SSZ) as an alternative to MTX to patients who do not have any poor prognostic features, who have a strong preference for an oral agent, and in whom LEF is contraindicated."	1
198801	"SSZ alone (begun at 500 mg twice daily and gradually increased [eg, by 500 mg per week] to up to 1000 mg two or three times daily) or in combination with hydroxychloroquine can be effective as the only DMARD in patients with early, severely active RA who lack poor prognostic factors."	1
198802	This approach is consistent with the recommendations of the American College of Rheumatology.	0
198803	"Discontinuation of SSZ due to toxicities may be required after two and five years of treatment in up to 30 and 50 percent of patients, respectively."	0
198804	Other studies suggest rates that are similar to those of LEF and MTX.	0
198805	"The most common toxicities include gastrointestinal upset, headache, and rash."	0
198806	Data that support the use of sulfasalazine in moderately to severely active RA are reviewed elsewhere.	0
198807	Other - Additional nonbiologic alternatives to MTX are reviewed elsewhere.	0
198808	The adverse effects of LEF and SSZ are discussed in detail elsewhere.	0
198809	Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or glucocorticoids act rapidly to control inflammation but do not provide adequate benefit for longer-term control of disease or for prevention of joint injury in most patients.	0
198810	"Moreover, chronic use of these agents, particularly glucocorticoids in moderate to high doses, is associated with significant risk of adverse effects."	0
198811	"We, thus, use these medications primarily for temporary control of disease activity in patients in whom treatment is being started with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or in whom adjunctive treatment is needed for persistent or flaring disease until treatment with DMARDs is sufficiently effective."	1
198812	"Some patients require ongoing use of such agents despite other therapies, but neither NSAIDs nor glucocorticoids should be considered as substitutes for effective treatment with DMARDs."	0
198813	We use NSAIDs initially in most patients with moderately to severely active disease.	1
198814	"We also initiate therapy with glucocorticoids in patients on the more severe end of this spectrum, while patients with less active disease who do not respond adequately to NSAIDs within two weeks should also receive treatment with glucocorticoids."	1
198815	"NSAIDs should be used at full therapeutic antiinflammatory doses for initial therapy of patients with moderately to severely active RA, unless contraindicated by gastrointestinal or renal disease or by heart failure."	1
198816	NSAIDs also provide analgesic benefit.	0
198817	"The dose of NSAIDs is titrated to the optimum tolerated level and is continued for at least two weeks before switching agents, because maximal analgesic and antiinflammatory effect is usually achieved within 10 to 14 days."	0
198818	The dose and duration of NSAIDs previously tried by the patient should be identified to determine if an adequate trial of one or more NSAIDs has already been attempted.	0
198819	The dose of a given medication required by different patients may vary.	0
198820	"Examples of effective antiinflammatory doses include 3200 mg of ibuprofen, 1000 mg of naproxen, or a single daily dose of a longer acting agent such as 20 mg of piroxicam."	0
198821	"A reduced dose and more frequent monitoring may be needed in older patients and in others who may be at greater risk of adverse effects, including renal insufficiency due to comorbidities or other medication use."	0
198822	"In patients at increased risk of NSAID gastropathy, such as those who are also receiving glucocorticoids or who have a history of peptic ulcer disease, appropriate measures should be undertaken to decrease risk of gastrointestinal complications such as use of a proton pump inhibitor, misoprostol, or possibly use of a selective COX-2 inhibitor (eg, celecoxib) rather than a nonselective NSAID."	1
198823	"Alternatives to the non-salicylate NSAIDs in such patients also include the non-acetylated salicylates (eg, salsalate at 2000 to 3000 mg/day), which have proven antiinflammatory activity with fewer adverse gastrointestinal effects."	0
198824	Patients should be cautioned regarding the risks of chronic use of NSAIDs.	0
198825	Effective management with DMARDs should allow for the discontinuation of daily full-dose NSAID use.	0
198826	Therapeutic trials of individual NSAIDs can continue until the patient has achieved adequate control of the inflammation with minimal side effects.	0
198827	Clinical experience indicates that there are relatively little or no benefit and an increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity when adding one NSAID to another.	0
198828	"Treatment with glucocorticoids should be offered if adequate symptomatic relief is not achieved within 10 to 14 days on NSAIDs alone, while awaiting benefit from DMARD therapy."	0
198829	Glucocorticoids act to rapidly reduce symptoms due to inflammatory synovitis in patients with RA.	1
198830	"Oral glucocorticoids are commonly used in RA, and some patients may benefit from intraarticular or intramuscular glucocorticoid administration in this setting."	0
198831	Glucocorticoid use is discussed briefly below.	0
198832	A more detailed discussion of glucocorticoid use in RA and of the data supporting its efficacy is presented elsewhere.	0
198833	There is also evidence that glucocorticoids retard radiographic progression in patients with RA in the short to medium term.	1
198834	"However, these agents should not be used alone for an extended period, and long-term treatment with glucocorticoids should be avoided, since their use may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality."	0
198835	"We suggest the use of oral glucocorticoids to help control disease activity in the initial treatment of severely active RA, particularly in early disease, and in the treatment of patients with less severe disease in whom a trial of NSAIDs has been inadequate."	1
198836	We use glucocorticoids in addition to NSAIDs because of their extremely rapid onset of action and the greater effectiveness in controlling symptoms for most patients with active RA.	1
198837	"Based upon our clinical experience, we usually initiate therapy with prednisone 5 to 20 mg/day, depending upon the severity of joint inflammation and upon the minimal dose required to obtain initial control."	0
198838	Most patients can be adequately controlled on 5 to 10 mg/day while initiating DMARDs.	0
198839	"Glucocorticoids should then be tapered as rapidly as tolerated with the goal of further tapering and eventual discontinuation, if possible, once disease control is achieved and can be maintained."	0
198840	"In general, the beneficial effects of DMARD therapy will permit reduction and discontinuation of the glucocorticoids, a goal of successful DMARD therapy, within four to six months."	0
198841	The efficacy of glucocorticoids in this setting has been shown in randomized trials and in a large number of observational studies.	0
198842	Some studies have used relatively high-dose glucocorticoids for initial therapy (prednisone 60 mg/day or equivalent).	0
198843	"However, lower doses are usually adequate when combined with effective DMARDs."	0
198844	"There are numerous risks associated with glucocorticoid use, and appropriate monitoring and precautions should be performed in all patients on these medications with respect to risks for osteoporosis, diabetes, and other adverse effects of hypercortisolism."	1
198845	"RA is considered an independent risk factor for osteoporotic fracture, and a fracture risk assessment should be performed to help guide treatment decisions."	0
198846	"In patients who must avoid daily oral glucocorticoids or who require an extremely rapid antiinflammatory response, an alternative to oral glucocorticoids is a single initial intramuscular injection of a depot preparation of methylprednisolone (80 to 120 mg), administered by deep intramuscular injection into the gluteal muscle."	1
198847	"Based upon the overall clinical response, up to two subsequent injections may be required at intervals of every four weeks to maintain improvement in symptoms, signs, and physical function, while slower-acting DMARDs exert their expected effect on controlling disease activity."	0
198848	Longer-term use is avoided to prevent harmful effects of glucocorticoids.	0
198849	"Intraarticular injections of long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, triamcinolone hexacetonide) are used to reduce synovitis in particular joints that are more inflamed than others."	0
198850	"In such patients, it may be difficult to distinguish between active joint inflammation due to RA alone and that due to infection."	0
198851	"Thus, when clinically indicated, joint fluid should be obtained to exclude infection."	0
198852	"In addition to the medications noted above, we use analgesic medications, such as acetaminophen, for additional pain relief if required."	0
198853	"We avoid the use of opioids because pain can be controlled in most patients with RA by effective use of NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, and DMARDs that control the disease process."	1
198854	Patients without evidence of very significant joint injury who appear to require opioids for adequate pain relief despite good control of disease activity should be evaluated for other comorbid conditions.	1
198855	"Disease activity and the response to therapy should be regularly reassessed, along with monitoring for drug toxicities, every three to five weeks until the patient is stable and disease is under control."	0
198856	"Subsequently, frequency of assessments should generally be no fewer than every three months."	0
198857	"Well-controlled patients who are seen less frequently may require laboratory monitoring beyond that performed at scheduled visits and should be counseled, as should all patients, to contact their treating clinician if the arthritis flares."	1
198858	Laboratory testing for the monitoring of disease activity and for the monitoring and prevention of drug toxicity is discussed separately.	0
198859	We periodically reevaluate disease activity using a quantitative composite measure at each assessment.	0
198860	More frequent laboratory monitoring may be required depending on the medications being used and following increases in dosing;	0
198861	more frequent clinical assessments may be required in patients experiencing a flare of disease or undergoing changes in therapy.	1
198862	We alter therapy if the disease remains active or progresses.	0
198863	We take the following approaches in patients who exhibit a persistent inflammatory synovitis that is resistant to the initial symptomatic therapies described above: We add oral glucocorticoids in patients begun on NSAIDs and DMARDs who continue to experience significant symptoms after 10 to 14 days of therapy.	1
198864	We use intraarticular glucocorticoids in individual joints when only a small number are resistant to therapy with systemic agents or if it is anticipated that a local injection may preclude the need for NSAIDs or systemic glucocorticoids.	0
198865	We suggest that patients who fail to achieve remission or low disease activity within three to six months of initiating therapy or who require more than approximately 5 to 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent glucocorticoid chronically to maintain a state of remission or low disease activity receive a more potent DMARD or combination of DMARDs.	1
198866	RA has natural exacerbations (also known as flares) and reductions of continuing disease activity.	0
198867	"It is important to distinguish a disease flare, characterized by symptoms and physical and laboratory findings of increased inflammatory synovitis, from noninflammatory causes of local or generalized increased pain."	0
198868	The severity of the flare and background drug therapy influence the choice of therapies.	0
198869	Drug therapy for flares is discussed in detail elsewhere.	0
198870	Most patients with moderately to severely active RA will require sustained therapy and adjustments in their treatment regimen over months to years to achieve treatment goals.	1
198871	"In the minority of patients who achieve a sustained clinical remission of greater than one year, we cautiously try to reduce DMARD doses while maintaining close monitoring to facilitate recognition of any recurrence of disease activity."	1
198872	"Although some patients may tolerate a reduced dose of medications, whether or not to discontinue DMARDs in patients in remission remains controversial."	1
198873	"We prefer to continue nonbiologic or biologic DMARD therapy at reduced doses, if possible, but do not discontinue DMARD therapy in most patients who have had moderately to severely active RA."	1
198874	Cautious reduction of biologic DMARD doses can be performed by increasing the interval between doses or by reducing the medication dose.	0
198875	"As an example, in a patient in clinical remission being treated with prednisone (7.5 mg/day) and MTX (20 mg/week), we would first try to reduce prednisone because of the risk of long-term adverse effects with glucocorticoids."	1
198876	"In such a patient, we would lower the glucocorticoid dose slowly (no faster than an average of 1 mg every two to four weeks), as long as there was no recurrence of disease activity."	0
198877	"If prednisone can be discontinued, or cannot but can be lowered to a dose no greater than 5 mg/day, we next decrease MTX."	0
198878	We reduce the MTX dose in 2.5 mg increments every two to three months as tolerated but generally to no lower than 15 mg/week.	0
198879	"A lower dose of MTX (eg, 10 to 12.5 mg/week) may be adequate to maintain remission in patients who are older or who have diminished renal function."	1
198880	Continued close monitoring is required in patients who discontinue their medications and who enter a period of possible drug-free remission.	1
198881	"The risk of disease recurrence in such patients is high, and flares of disease may occur even several years after stopping therapy."	0
198882	"Additionally, clinical remission can be difficult to achieve upon resumption of DMARD therapy in patients who have discontinued all DMARDs."	1
198883	"The best candidates for achieving a drug-free remission appear to be patients with the following characteristics: a short duration of symptoms when treatment is started, male sex, the absence of autoantibodies, and receipt of early intensive therapy."	1
198884	"UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, ""The Basics"" and ""Beyond the Basics."""	0
198885	"The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition."	0

198898	and participation of a rheumatologist in the evaluation and ongoing care of the patient.	0
198899	Patient education and other nonpharmacologic and preventive therapies are needed for all patients with RA.	0

198903	"Alternative DMARDs for patients unable to take MTX include a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor, preferably etanercept or adalimumab, or leflunomide."	1
198904	"We limit the use of sulfasalazine as an alternative to MTX to patients who do not have any poor prognostic features, who have a strong preference for an oral agent, and in whom leflunomide is contraindicated."	1
198905	"In patients with moderately to severely active RA, we use antiinflammatory drug therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids, preferably on a temporary basis, to quickly achieve control of signs and symptoms of disease."	1
198906	We use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in all patients without contraindications to their use.	1
198907	"In patients with more severe disease or with moderate disease resistant to a brief course of NSAIDs, we suggest the use of glucocorticoids."	1
198908	We then taper and withdraw these medications once DMARDs have taken effect.	0
198909	We use intraarticular injections of long-acting glucocorticoids to reduce synovitis in particular joints that are more inflamed than others.	0
198910	"When clinically indicated, joint fluid should be obtained to exclude infection."	0
198911	"During the initial treatment of patients with moderately to severely active RA, the patient should be reevaluated every three to five weeks for the effectiveness of therapy and for the monitoring of possible drug toxicity."	1

209389	Unipolar major depression (major depressive disorder) is diagnosed in patients who have suffered at least one major depressive episode and have no history of mania or hypomania.	1
209390	"A major depressive episode is a period lasting at least two weeks, with five or more of the following symptoms: depressed mood, anhedonia, insomnia or hypersomnia, change in appetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor concentration, thoughts of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts about death or suicide."	0
209391	"Patients with mild to moderate major depression manifest: Either no suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior, or suicidal or homicidal ideation that does not pose an imminent risk (eg, thoughts that family members would be better off if the patient was dead; or fleeting thoughts of killing oneself, with nonexistent or vague plans to commit suicide and no intent)."	1

209397	"However, pharmacotherapy alone and psychotherapy alone are reasonable alternatives;"	0
209398	antidepressants and psychotherapy have each demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy in randomized trials.	0
209399	"In addition, randomized trials that compared pharmacotherapy alone with psychotherapy alone in depressed outpatients found that the benefits of each modality were comparable."	0
209400	"The efficacy of combination therapy, pharmacotherapy alone, and psychotherapy alone are discussed elsewhere in this topic."	0
209401	"Antidepressants alone have been studied and used more often than combination treatment or psychotherapy alone because antidepressants are more available and convenient than psychotherapy, and many patients prefer pharmacotherapy."	0
209402	"However, one advantage provided by psychotherapy (particularly CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy) is that following an acute course of treatment, the benefits often persist and patients remain well."	0
209403	"By contrast, relapse is common in patients who remit after acute treatment with antidepressants and then discontinue their medications."	1
209404	"Other factors to consider in selecting a treatment regimen are prior treatment history, comorbidity, psychosocial stressors, patient preference, and cost."	0
209405	"There are no biologic, genetic, or clinical predictors of sufficient utility to help choose between antidepressants and psychotherapy, or to make a selection among specific antidepressants or psychotherapies."	0
209406	"Although preliminary studies suggest that differences in central nervous system functioning (eg, brain glucose metabolism and biochemical changes) may distinguish depressed patients who respond preferentially to pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy, the use of biomarkers to select initial treatment for depression is not standard practice."	1
209407	"The use of pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy alone, or psychotherapy alone for mild to moderate depression is consistent with practice guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and the United Kingdom National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)."	0

209414	Evidence supporting the superiority of combination therapy over pharmacotherapy alone for the initial treatment of mild to moderate major depression includes many randomized trials.	0
209415	"As an example, a meta-analysis of 25 randomized trials compared antidepressants alone with combination therapy in 2036 patients with depressive disorders."	1
209416	"The analysis found a significant, clinically small to moderate effect favoring combination therapy."	0
209417	"In addition, discontinuation of treatment for any reason was lower with combination treatment (odds ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.8)."	0
209418	"Separate analyses of the three subgroups that received cognitive-behavioral therapy (7 trials), interpersonal psychotherapy (8 trials), or other psychotherapies (10 trials) found that in each case, combined therapy was superior to antidepressants alone."	0
209419	Evidence supporting the superiority of antidepressants plus psychotherapy over psychotherapy alone for the initial treatment of mild to moderate major depression includes many randomized trials.	0
209420	"As an example, a meta-analysis of 16 randomized trials compared psychotherapy alone with combination treatment in 1727 patients with depressive disorders."	1
209421	"Recovery was more likely with combination therapy (relative risk 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.4)."	0
209422	One concern that we have in evaluating trials that include psychotherapy is the lack of blinding.	0
209423	Second-generation antidepressants that are available to treat unipolar major depression include: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).	0
209424	Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.	0
209425	Atypical antidepressants.	0
209426	Serotonin modulators.	0
209427	"Older, first-generation antidepressants include: Tricyclic antidepressants."	0
209428	Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).	0
209429	"For patients with mild to moderate unipolar major depression whose initial treatment includes antidepressants, we suggest SSRIs based upon their efficacy and tolerability in randomized trials."	1
209430	SSRIs are the most widely prescribed class of antidepressants.	0
209431	"Reasonable alternatives to SSRIs for the initial treatment of major depression include other second-generation antidepressants such as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, atypical antidepressants, and serotonin modulators."	0
209432	"Multiple reviews have concluded that the efficacy of different antidepressants is generally comparable across and within classes, and that there are no robust or replicated results that have established clinically meaningful differences."	0
209433	Tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors are typically not used as initial treatment because of concerns about safety (particularly in overdose) and adverse effects.	0
209434	"Although sertraline is one of the most widely prescribed SSRIs, and there is evidence that suggests escitalopram and sertraline provide the best combination of efficacy and acceptability, each SSRI is suitable for the initial treatment of depression."	0
209435	"Studies that suggest antidepressants (including SSRIs) differ in their efficacy include a network meta-analysis of 117 randomized trials (mean duration 8 weeks), which compared 12 second-generation antidepressants in nearly 26,000 patients with unipolar major depression."	1
209436	"The investigators concluded that escitalopram and sertraline showed the best combined profile of efficacy and acceptability, based upon the findings that: Response (reduction of baseline symptoms >=50 percent) was more probable with escitalopram, mirtazapine, sertraline, and venlafaxine, compared with duloxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine."	0
209437	"Discontinuation of treatment for any reason was less probable with citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline, compared with other antidepressants."	0
209438	"However, a second network meta-analysis (93 randomized trials, >20,000 patients with unipolar major depression) evaluated 13 second-generation antidepressants and concluded that there were no substantial differences in efficacy and discontinuation rates."	1
209439	"In contrast to the first network meta-analysis, the second one excluded trials with a high risk of bias and open label designs."	0
209440	The primary findings from the second study included the following: Most of the differences between antidepressants that were found in the first study were not replicated in the second study.	0
209441	"Although the second study did find a few statistically significant differences, these were judged to be small and not clinically relevant."	0
209442	"As an example, improvement was greater with escitalopram than citalopram, but the average difference on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, which ranges in score from 0 to 60 points, was 1.5 points."	0
209443	Information about interpreting results from conventional and network meta-analyses is discussed separately.	0
209444	Onset of action may be faster with mirtazapine than other antidepressants.	0
209445	"A systematic review identified seven randomized trials that found response occurred sooner with mirtazapine than citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline."	0
209446	"However, all of the studies were funded by the manufacturer of mirtazapine, and after four weeks, response rates were generally comparable."	0
209447	"Most depressed patients who are treated with antidepressants require continuation treatment, and beyond that, maintenance treatment may be indicated as well."	1
209448	"However, randomized trials have found no evidence that one antidepressant is superior in preventing relapse or recurrence."	0

209462	"Clinicians should bear in mind that nonspecific factors (eg, conveying empathy, establishing rapport, developing a therapeutic alliance and sense of collaboration, and instilling hope) may be as important as the choice of antidepressant."	0
209463	"For initial treatment of mild to moderate depression, it is important to select medications that patients can tolerate at doses sufficient to achieve remission."	0
209464	Self report scales are available for eliciting antidepressants side effects during treatment.	0
209465	"Although some adverse effects (eg, gastrointestinal toxicity) are common across second-generation antidepressants, the incidence of specific side effects during short-term treatment (eg, 6 to 12 weeks) differs among drugs: Diarrhea occurs more often with sertraline than bupropion, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, and venlafaxine (16 versus 8 percent of patients)."	0
209466	Nausea and vomiting occurs more often with venlafaxine than SSRIs as a class (33 versus 22 percent).	0
209467	"Sexual dysfunction occurs more often with escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline than bupropion (16 versus 6 percent; paroxetine is especially problematic)."	0
209468	"Somnolence occurs more often with trazodone than bupropion, fluoxetine, mirtazapine, paroxetine, and venlafaxine (42 versus 25 percent)."	0
209469	"Weight gain is greater with mirtazapine than fluoxetine, paroxetine, trazodone, and venlafaxine (0.8 to 3.0 kg after six to eight weeks of treatment)."	0
209470	"Although antidepressants may be associated with an increased risk of diabetes, the evidence is not compelling and the possible association should not deter clinicians from using antidepressants when indicated."	0
209471	"A nested case-control study found that in approximately 166,000 patients with depression and no sign of diabetes, long-term (>24 months) use of an antidepressant in moderate to high doses was associated with an increased risk of diabetes (incidence rate ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.5)."	1
209472	"However, depression itself may be a risk factor for developing diabetes."	0
209473	"A prospective observational study of 1000 people 65 years and older, followed for up to ten years, found that depressed individuals were more than twice as likely to develop diabetes compared to those without depression, regardless of antidepressant treatment (hazard ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.1)."	0
209474	Antidepressants were also found to be associated with stroke in a study that used a claims data base.	0
209475	"Problems with the study, including confounds and the possibility of reverse causality, lead us to suggest that clinicians should not change their practice with regard to this issue until better designed studies have been conducted."	0
209476	Information about SSRIs and stroke is discussed separately.	0
209477	Antidepressants can rarely injure the liver.	0
209478	"A review of 158 studies estimated that among patients taking antidepressants, asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases occurs in 0.5 to 1 percent of patients taking SSRIs or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and up to 3 percent of patients taking MAOIs or tricyclics."	1
209479	Liver failure leading to liver transplantation or death has also been reported.	0
209480	"Hepatotoxicity generally appears within the first six months of treatment, and can manifest with anorexia, fatigue, nausea, and weakness."	0
209481	"Although antidepressant induced liver injury is generally idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and not related to dose, patients who are elderly or taking multiple medications may be at higher risk;"	1
209482	"we thus suggest measuring hepatic enzymes in these patients as well as patients with known underlying liver disease, prior to starting antidepressants."	1
209483	Initial management of drug induced liver injury is withdrawal of the offending drug.	0
209484	"Additional information about drug induced liver injury, including hepatotoxicity due to agomelatine and nefazodone, are discussed separately."	0
209485	"Additional information about side effects of antidepressants is discussed separately in the drug information topic for each drug, as well topics that review antidepressant classes."	0
209486	We suggest starting antidepressants at low doses in order to reduce side effects and improve adherence;	0
209487	typical starting doses are shown in a table.	0
209488	"However, doses lower than the typical starting doses may further reduce adverse effects, particularly in older patients and those sensitive to side effects."	1
209489	"As an example, depressed patients with comorbid anxiety disorders who are started on SSRIs may better tolerate half of the usual starting dose."	1
209490	"The dose can then be titrated up to the minimum, usual total daily dose (therapeutic dose)."	0
209491	"For depressed patients who do not respond to the minimum therapeutic dose of SSRIs, most clinicians increase the dose within the therapeutic dose range, consistent with suggestions in multiple practice guidelines."	1
209492	"Although this approach has been questioned because randomized trials have not found any advantage in escalating the dose, the trials had methodologic problems."	0
209493	"As an example, four randomized trials enrolled patients (total N = 609) with unipolar major depression who were unresponsive to three weeks of treatment with an SSRI, and compared increasing the dose with continuing the initial dose."	1
209494	Improvement was comparable for the two groups in all four trials.	0
209495	"However, three weeks is generally regarded as too short an interval for determining whether an antidepressant regimen is beneficial."	0
209496	"Some patients benefit from doses that exceed the maximum therapeutic dose, provided the drug is safely tolerated."	0
209497	Patients may rapidly metabolize drugs due to genetic polymorphisms of hepatic enzymes and thus require larger doses.	0
209498	"One review noted that the prevalence of increased metabolism by duplicated genes of CYP2D6 in black Ethiopians was 29 percent, and among whites varied from 1 to 2 percent in Sweden to 7 to 10 percent in Spain."	0
209499	Additional information about the role of genetic factors in drug metabolism and response is discussed separately.	0
209500	Patients receiving high doses should be regularly monitored for side effects and nonadherence.	1
209501	"Additional information about starting doses, titration schedules, and target doses of antidepressants is discussed in topics that review antidepressant classes."	0
209502	"Among patients with mild to moderate unipolar major depression who start antidepressants, improvement is often apparent within one to two weeks: A meta-analysis of 28 randomized trials (5872 patients with unipolar major depression) that compared SSRIs with placebo found that superior clinical improvement with SSRIs occurred within one week."	1
209503	A pooled analysis of four randomized trials found that the mean time to improvement (reduction of baseline symptoms >=20 percent) in 2532 patients treated with antidepressants was approximately 13 days.	1
209504	Early improvement during initial treatment of mild to moderate major depression with antidepressants may predict eventual remission.	0
209505	"A pooled analysis of 41 randomized trials (6562 patients with unipolar major depression who were generally treated for six weeks) found that early improvement (reduction of baseline symptoms within the first two weeks of treatment >=20 percent) was a sensitive predictor of eventual remission (range 87 to 100 percent, depending upon the specific treatment)."	1
209506	"Among all the patients who remitted, more than 90 percent were early improvers."	1
209507	"In addition, antidepressants can provide an early response (eg, reduction of baseline symptoms >=50 percent)."	0
209508	A meta-analysis of 41 randomized trials compared antidepressants with placebo in 7121 patients with unipolar major depression.	1
209509	"Response was more likely with active treatment than placebo within one week of starting treatment (odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1)."	0
209510	We generally treat mild to moderate unipolar major depression for 6 to 12 weeks before deciding whether antidepressants have sufficiently relieved symptoms.	0
209511	"However, for patients who show little improvement (eg, reduction of baseline symptoms <=25 percent) after 4 to 6 weeks, it is reasonable to administer next-step treatment."	1
209512	"Our approach, which is consistent with multiple practice guidelines, is based upon the following: The large majority of randomized antidepressant trials for the initial treatment of unipolar major depression last 6 to 12 weeks."	0
209513	"In addition, the prospective Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, which treated a sample that was more generalizable than is typically enrolled in randomized trials, found that among 943 patients who were treated with open label citalopram, nearly 25 percent required 10 or 12 weeks of treatment to achieve remission."	1
209514	Other prospective observational studies (N = 804 and 627) found that many patients required 8 to 12 weeks to substantially improve or remit.	0
209515	"A meta-analysis of 28 randomized trials (5872 patients with unipolar major depression) that compared SSRIs with placebo found that the advantage of SSRIs over placebo continued to increase for at least six weeks of treatment, but at a progressively smaller rate."	1
209516	A 16 week study enrolled 566 patients with unipolar major depression who were initially treated with open label escitalopram (10 mg per day) for 4 weeks and showed minimal improvement (<30 percent reduction of baseline symptoms).	1
209517	"Patients were randomly assigned to switch immediately to duloxetine (60 to 120 mg per day) for 12 weeks, or to continue escitalopram (10 to 20 mg per day) for another 4 weeks."	0
209518	Patients who received escitalopram for 8 weeks were then evaluated for response (reduction of baseline symptoms >=50 percent);	1
209519	"responders remained on escitalopram for the duration of the trial, whereas nonresponders switched to duloxetine."	0
209520	"Remission at week 16 occurred in more patients who switched immediately after 4 weeks of open label treatment, compared with patients who were assigned to the other treatment strategy (43 versus 36 percent)."	1
209521	"An eight week, prospective, observational study examined response (reduction of baseline symptoms >=50 percent) to fluoxetine 20 mg per day in 143 patients with unipolar major depression."	1
209522	"Among patients who showed minimal improvement (reduction of baseline symptoms <=20 percent) by week four, response by week eight occurred in 19 percent."	1
209523	"Among patients who showed minimal improvement by week six, response by week eight occurred in 7 percent."	1
209524	Next step treatments for patients unresponsive to initial treatment of depression are discussed separately.	1
209525	Antidepressants are beneficial for patients with unipolar major depression.	1
209526	A meta-analysis of patient level data from 37 randomized trials (N >8400 patients with major depression) compared either fluoxetine (modal dose 20 mg per day) or venlafaxine (modal dose range 75 to 150 mg per day) with placebo for six weeks;	0
209527	remission occurred in more patients who received active drug than placebo (43 versus 29 percent).	1
209528	"Meta-analyses of randomized, placebo controlled trials have found that many antidepressant classes and other specific antidepressants are efficacious in unipolar major depression, including agomelatine (not available in the United States), duloxetine, paroxetine, tricyclics (including amitriptyline imipramine, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. However, meta-analyses based upon published randomized trials may overestimate the effect of antidepressants because of selective publication of trials (publication bias)."	0
209529	A study of 12 second-generation antidepressants compared drug trials that were published with trials that were registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA);	0
209530	drug companies are required to submit all trials when registering a drug for approval by a regulatory agency.	0
209531	"The primary findings included the following: Of the 74 trials that were registered, 31 percent (23 trials) were not published."	0
209532	"Among the 51 published trials, the results were presented as positive (ie, improvement was greater with the drug than placebo) in 94 percent (48 trials);"	0
209533	"by contrast, the US FDA found that among the 74 registered trials, only 51 percent were positive."	0
209534	"Of the 48 trials that were published as positive, the US FDA determined that 23 percent (11 trials) were negative."	0
209535	The clinical effect of antidepressants was larger in the journal reports than the registered trials.	0
209536	"The advantage of antidepressants over placebo is typically 2 to 4 points on a standard rating scale such as the 17 item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, which ranges from 0 to 52 points."	0
209537	"As an example, a meta-analysis of patient level data (37 randomized trials, 8477 patients with unipolar major depression who were assessed with the Hamilton scale) found that improvement with antidepressants and placebo differed by 3 points."	0
209538	"The small advantage of antidepressants over placebo in depressed patients is due in part to the nonspecific clinical effects of placebo treatment, which often lead to remission."	0
209539	"As an example, a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 37 randomized trials found that among 3391 patients with mild to moderate major depression who were treated with placebo, remission occurred in 29 percent."	1
209540	Receiving placebos in clinical trials is not equivalent to receiving no treatment.	0
209541	Depressed study patients who are treated with placebos receive nonspecific support by meeting regularly with clinicians and research assistants to discuss symptoms and functioning.	1
209542	"Placebos may act by instilling hope, raising expectations of improvement, and motivating patients to please investigators."	0
209543	"In addition, placebo responses may be related to genetic polymorphisms."	0
209544	"Antidepressants appear to be efficacious for unipolar major depression regardless of baseline severity, including mild episodes."	0
209545	A meta-analysis of 37 randomized trials (8477 patients with major depression) that compared antidepressants with placebo found that the rate of remission in mild episodes (scores on the Hamilton rating Scale for Depression <=19; ) at six weeks was greater with active drug than placebo (50 versus 37 percent of patients).	1
209546	This difference may underestimate antidepressant effects over longer time periods.	0
209547	"The belief that pharmacotherapy benefits only patients who are more severely ill stems in part from a meta-analysis of six randomized trials (718 depressed patients, primarily major depression) that compared antidepressants with placebo;"	1
209548	results suggested a substantial benefit in severe depression and little or no benefit in mild to moderate depression.	0
209549	"Although both meta-analyses utilized patient level data, the larger one is more compelling than the earlier one because it included more patients."	0
209550	"In addition, the earlier study included patients with minor depression (N = 77);"	1
209551	antidepressants are typically not beneficial for minor depression.	0
209552	"Nevertheless, there are hundreds of other randomized trials that were not included in either meta-analysis."	0
209553	An analysis that included patient level data from these other trials would provide a better basis for evaluating the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in mild episodes of major depression.	0
209554	Psychotherapies that are available to treat unipolar major depression include: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).	0

209560	"Among the major psychotherapies, there is no compelling evidence that one is superior to the rest;"	0
209561	"thus, the choice is usually made upon the basis of availability and patient preference."	0
209562	CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy are frequently selected for the initial treatment of mild to moderate unipolar major depression because they have been more widely studied than other types of psychotherapies.	0
209563	Randomized trials that have compared the efficacy of psychotherapy interventions for treating mild to moderate unipolar depression have found that the differences are minor.	0
209564	"As an example, a network meta-analysis of 198 randomized trials (n >15,000 depressed patients) compared the efficacy of seven psychotherapies (behavioral activation, cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, problem solving therapy, psychodynamic therapy, social skills training, and supportive therapy)."	0
209565	"The primary findings were as follows: Each therapy was superior to the waiting list control condition, and the clinical benefits were moderate to large."	0
209566	"Each therapy (except social skills training) was superior to usual care, with clinical benefits that were small to moderate."	0
209567	The benefits of each therapy were generally comparable.	0
209568	"Other psychotherapies (eg, schema therapy, which is a type of cognitive therapy) may be beneficial as well."	0
209569	"For initial treatment of mild to moderate unipolar major depression, a reasonable alternative to conventional psychotherapy (administered face-to-face by a therapist each session) is clinician guided self help therapy."	0
209570	"Clinician guided self help therapy relies upon structured workbooks (hardcopy, compact disc, or internet-based), audiotapes, or videotapes, and involves minimal, intermittent contact with a clinician or paraprofessional who provides encouragement and monitors progress."	0
209571	Evidence supporting the use of clinician guided self help includes randomized trials.	0
209572	"A meta-analysis of individual patient data from 13 randomized trials (2470 depressed patients) compared clinician guided self help therapy with usual care and found that active treatment provided a significant, small to moderate clinical benefit."	0
209573	"In addition, patients with moderate depression at baseline appeared to benefit at least as much as mildly ill patients."	1
209574	The use of clinician guided self help therapy for initial treatment of mild to moderate depression is consistent with multiple practice guidelines.	0
209575	"For patients with mild episodes of unipolar major depression who do not require monitoring (eg, patients with no suicidal ideation or behavior), self-guided self help therapy is a reasonable alternative to conventional psychotherapies as well as clinician guided self help therapy."	1
209576	"Self guided interventions utilize similar materials (eg, structured workbook) that are used in clinician guided self help, but self guided self help is conducted independently and involves no contact with a clinician."	0
209577	"Patients should thus be instructed to visit their clinicians if the depressive syndrome is unresponsive or progresses (eg, suicidal ideation occurs, the number or intensity of symptoms increases, or psychosocial functioning deteriorates)."	0
209578	"Evidence supporting self guided self help therapy includes a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials (1362 depressed patients) that compared self administered interventions (all based upon CBT; nearly all internet based) with control conditions (eg, usual care or waiting lists)."	0
209579	"The analysis found a significant, but clinically small benefit favoring active treatment."	0
209580	"In addition, the benefits of self guided self help therapy persisted for up to 12 months posttreatment."	0
209581	"Psychotherapy is efficacious for the initial treatment of mild to moderate unipolar major depression, based upon randomized trials."	0
209582	"As an example, a meta-analysis of 70 trials (5403 patients) compared psychotherapy (generally one session per week; mean number of total sessions 12) with a control condition (eg, waiting list or usual care)."	0
209583	"The primary findings were as follows: Improvement was superior with psychotherapy, and the clinical effect was moderately large;"	0
209584	heterogeneity across studies was moderate and there was a strong indication of publication bias.	0
209585	The total number of sessions and the number of sessions per week were not associated with the clinical benefit of psychotherapy.	0
209586	"However, meta-analyses appear to overestimate the clinical effect for nearly all types of psychotherapy in treating depression."	0
209587	These inflated effects seem to be the result of low quality studies as well as publication bias.	0
209588	"Psychotherapy studies are methodologically variable, like pharmacotherapy studies."	0
209589	"Some psychotherapy trials are rigorous and specify a priori hypotheses and analytic tests, develop manuals for the psychotherapies and measure adherence on the part of therapists, use active psychotherapy comparators that control for the nonspecific aspects of psychotherapy, use standardized diagnostic criteria and outcome measures, stratify patients on predetermined risk variables, and blind outcome ratings."	1
209590	"Less meticulous studies use open-label designs, less rigorous comparators (eg, treatment as usual or waiting lists), or fail to adequately blind outcome ratings."	0
209591	"Although it is commonly believed that blinding of patients in psychotherapy is less successful compared with pharmacotherapy trials, this has never been studied."	1
209592	"In addition, the overlap among psychotherapies makes it difficult to interpret some studies."	0
209593	"As an example, techniques from supportive psychotherapy have been adopted by other psychotherapies, such as psychodynamic psychotherapy."	0
209594	"Another example is behavioral activation, which is derived from and represents the behavioral component of cognitive-behavioral therapy."	0
209595	"For patients with mild to moderate unipolar major depression, the evidence indicates that the efficacy of psychotherapy compared with antidepressants at the end of treatment is generally comparable."	1
209596	A meta-analysis of 30 randomized trials compared psychotherapy (primarily CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy) with antidepressants in 3178 patients with depressive disorders and found that improvement was comparable for both groups.	1
209597	"However, persistence of acute treatment effects is superior with psychotherapy than antidepressants."	0
209598	"As an example, a meta-analysis of 28 randomized trials compared psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy for the acute treatment of 3381 patients with unipolar depressive disorders, and found that improvement was comparable;"	1
209599	heterogeneity across studies was moderate.	0
209600	"In the 11 studies (602 patients) that followed patients after treatment ended and assessed their depressive symptoms (mean length of follow-up 15 months), there was a significant, clinically small to moderate effect favoring psychotherapy over antidepressants."	0
209601	The rate of relapse following acute treatment with psychotherapy or antidepressants is discussed separately.	0
209602	"For patients with mild to moderate unipolar major depression, we suggest adding relaxation techniques (eg, progressive muscle relaxation, relaxation imagery, and autogenic training) to the primary treatment regimen."	1
209603	A meta-analysis of 5 randomized trials (136 patients) compared relaxation with no treatment and found a clinically moderate benefit favoring relaxation.	0
209604	"However, a second analysis of nine trials (286 patients) found that relaxation was less effective than psychotherapy (primarily cognitive-behavioral therapy)."	0
209605	"Clinicians should also encourage patients to pursue positive activities (""behavioral activation"") that may have ceased due to depression."	0
209606	Patients may take the position that they will engage in those activities after they are less depressed;	0
209607	clinicians need to explain that engaging in these activities is a means of relieving depression.	0
209608	"We suggest exercise as adjunctive treatment for patients with mild to moderate major depression, based upon evidence from low quality randomized trials."	1
209609	"In addition, exercise may provide other health benefits beyond relief of depression."	0
209610	"For patients with mild depression, exercise alone rather than as add-on treatment is a reasonable alternative provided patients are sufficiently monitored (eg, every two to four weeks) for worsening symptoms."	1
209611	Prescribing exercise as adjunctive treatment or monotherapy is consistent with multiple practice guidelines.	0
209612	"Although many studies suggest that exercise is beneficial for depressive disorders, the evidence is not compelling: A meta-analysis of 35 randomized trials (1356 depressed patients) compared exercise with no treatment or a control intervention and found a moderate clinical benefit favoring exercise."	0
209613	"However, heterogeneity across studies was moderate, and in the 6 higher quality (eg, outcome assessed by blinded raters) trials that included 464 patients, there was only a small clinical effect favoring exercise that did not reach statistical significance."	0
209614	"In a separate meta-analysis of four randomized trials that compared exercise with no treatment or placebo in 271 depressed patients who were recruited from clinical settings, there was no advantage for exercise."	1
209615	Patients recruited from clinical settings may be more depressed and less responsive to exercise than depressed individuals recruited from other settings.	1
209616	Subsequent randomized trials have also found that exercise provides no benefit for depression.	0
209617	"As an example, a randomized trial (N = 361 depressed patients) found that offering support and encouragement to exercise (rather than providing exercise) as an adjunct to usual care was not beneficial."	0
209618	"Based upon a review of randomized trials, we suggest that clinicians prescribe exercise for depressed patients in the following manner: Modality - Aerobic exercise (eg, walking, running, or cycling) or resistance training (upper and lower body weight lifting)."	1
209619	Session frequency - Three to five exercise sessions per week.	0
209620	Session duration - 45 to 60 minutes per session.	0
209621	Exercise intensity.	0
209622	Aerobic exercise: 50 to 85 percent maximum heart rate.	0
209623	Resistance training: three sets of 8 repetitions at 80 percent of maximum weight that can be lifted in a single repetition for a given exercise.	0
209624	Intervention duration - At least 10 weeks.	0
209625	Additional information about exercise prescription is discussed separately.	0
209626	Adherence to either exercise or SSRIs appears to be comparable.	0
209627	"Strategies for improving adherence with exercise include altering the type and frequency of activity according to patient preferences, motivational interviewing (motivating the patient to exercise by eliciting both the patient's reasons to do so and the patient's ambivalence about change), goal-setting, and providing feedback to patients."	0
209628	Motivational interviewing is discussed separately.	0
209629	Primary care patients with mild to moderate unipolar major depression can benefit when antidepressant treatment occurs within the context of collaborative care.	1
209630	"Collaborative care involves treating patients with a team that usually includes a primary care clinician (who prescribes antidepressants), a case manager who provides support and outreach to patients, and a mental health specialist (eg, psychiatrist) who provides consultation and supervision."	1
209631	"Meta-analyses of randomized trials have shown that depression outcomes are superior with collaborative care, compared with usual care (antidepressants alone)."	0
209632	"However, antidepressants alone are a reasonable alternative."	0
209633	Psychotherapy is also a reasonable alternative to collaborative care for depressed patients who are treated in primary care settings.	1
209634	"The evidence for the efficacy of collaborative care is discussed separately, as is the efficacy of antidepressants alone and psychotherapy alone for primary care patients."	0
209635	"Anxiolytics can be used to augment an antidepressant for initially treating major depressive episodes that include symptoms of anxiety (eg, ruminative thoughts, worrying, and panic attacks), insomnia, or psychomotor agitation."	0
209636	"The indications, general principles, and efficacy of specific anxiolytic drug options are discussed separately."	0
209637	Anxiety symptoms that are part of a depressive syndrome are distinguished from anxiety disorders.	0
209638	Treatment of anxiety disorders is discussed separately.	0
209639	The clinical features of severe major depression include: Suicidal or homicidal behavior or ideation with a specific plan and intent.	0
209640	"Psychotic features (eg, delusions or hallucinations)."	0
209641	Catatonia.	0
209642	Poor judgement that places the patient or others at imminent risk of being harmed.	1
209643	"Grossly impaired functioning (eg, food and fluid refusal leading to malnutrition and dehydration)."	0
209644	Severely ill patients should be referred to a psychiatrist for management and generally require hospitalization.	0
209645	"For patients with severe unipolar major depression, we suggest initial treatment with the combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, based upon randomized trials in patients with mild to moderate depressionsertraline or amitriptyline) with clinical management (psychoeducation and support) plus an antidepressant in 124 patients with major depression who were hospitalized for five weeks."	1
209646	"Response (reduction of baseline symptoms >=50 percent) occurred in more patients treated with adjunctive interpersonal psychotherapy than clinical management (70 versus 51 percent), and improvement of functioning was also superior with interpersonal psychotherapy."	1
209647	"In addition, the benefits of interpersonal psychotherapy persisted for up to 12 months."	0
209648	"However, a reasonable alternative to combination therapy for severe major depression is pharmacotherapy alone, based upon randomized trials in patients with severe depression."	1
209649	"Another reasonable alternative to combination therapy for the initial treatment of severe major depression is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), especially for patients who require a fast response (eg, patients with suicidal ideation or behavior that is life-threatening)."	1
209650	Meta-analyses of randomized trials indicate that ECT is more efficacious than any other treatment for severe major depression.	0
209651	"However, ECT is associated with safety risks, adverse effects, logistical constraints, and patient refusal;"	0
209652	"in addition, relapse rates following remission are high."	0
209653	"An overview of ECT is discussed separately, as are indications for and efficacy of ECT in unipolar major depression, medical consultation for ECT, and the technique for performing ECT."	0
209654	"The use of combination therapy, pharmacotherapy alone, or ECT for severe unipolar major depression is consistent with practice guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and the United Kingdom National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)."	0
209655	Additional information about treating major depression with psychotic features or catatonia is discussed separately.	0
209656	"For the initial treatment of severe unipolar major depression, we use serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs."	0
209657	Randomized trials have demonstrated that antipsychotics combined with either serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs are efficacious for unipolar major depression with psychotic features.	0
209658	We typically start with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.	0
209659	"A pooled analysis of 15 randomized trials (1752 patient with unipolar major depression) compared serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine, milnacipran, and venlafaxine) with SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline. In the subgroup of hospitalized patients (n = 436), remission occurred in more patients who received serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors than SSRIs (52 versus 29 percent)."	1
209660	This was consistent with the finding that remission was greater in outpatients who received serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.	1
209661	A reasonable alternative to serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs is mirtazapine: A six-week randomized trial compared mirtazapine (24 to 72 mg per day) with trazodone (150 to 450 mg per day) in 200 patients hospitalized for major depression.	1
209662	Response (reduction of baseline symptoms >=50 percent) occurred in more patients treated with mirtazapine than trazodone (78 versus 61 percent).	1
209663	"Although mirtazapine was generally well tolerated, one patient completed suicide and two suicide attempts occurred in the mirtazapine group."	0
209664	An eight-week randomized trial compared mirtazapine (mean dose 50 mg per day) with venlafaxine (mean dose 255 mg per day) in 157 inpatients and found that response was comparable (62 and 52 percent).	0
209665	"In addition, discontinuation of treatment due to adverse effects occurred in fewer patients who received mirtazapine than venlafaxine (15 versus 5 percent)."	1
209666	"Tricyclic antidepressants are another reasonable alternative, based upon randomized trials that suggest tricyclics are more efficacious than other antidepressants for severely depressed patients."	0
209667	"However, tricyclics are frequently avoided due to their greater safety hazards (eg, cardiotoxicity and potential lethality with overdose) and less favorable side effect profiles."	0
209668	"Evidence that indicates tricyclics (particularly amitriptyline, clomipramine, and imipramine) are beneficial for severely depressed patients includes the following studies: A meta-analysis of 104 randomized trials compared amitriptyline with other antidepressants (including other tricyclics) in 7422 depressed patients."	0
209669	"In the subgroup of 54 randomized trials that enrolled hospitalized patients (sample size not provided), response was more likely with amitriptyline than other antidepressants (odds ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.04-1.42) and tolerability was comparable."	1
209670	This was consistent with the finding that response was more likely with amitriptyline in the total sample.	0
209671	"A meta-analysis of 25 randomized trials compared tricyclics (amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine, and maprotiline) with SSRIs (citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine) for treating depression in 1377 hospitalized patients."	0
209672	"Improvement was greater with tricyclics than SSRIs, but the clinical difference was small and heterogeneity across studies was significant."	0
209673	"In addition, discontinuation of treatment due to adverse effects occurred in more patients treated with tricyclics than SSRIs (14 versus 9 percent)."	1
209674	"The pharmacology, administration, and side effects of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, mirtazapine, and tricyclics are discussed separately."	0
209675	Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by dysphoria and at least two other depressive symptoms lasting for two or more years.	0
209676	The diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder subsumes the previously used diagnoses of dysthymic disorder and chronic major depression (major depression lasting for at least two years).	0
209677	The diagnostic criteria for persistent depressive disorder and the prior diagnosis of dysthymic disorder are virtually identical.	0
209678	The diagnosis of dysthymic disorder is discussed separately.	0
209679	"For initial treatment of persistent depressive disorder, we suggest in order of preference pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy alone, and psychotherapy alone, based upon randomized trials."	0
209680	Evidence for the efficacy of antidepressants plus psychotherapy for persistent depressive disorder includes a meta-analysis of nine trials (1590 patients with chronic major depression or dysthymic disorder) that compared combination treatment with pharmacotherapy alone and psychotherapy alone;	1
209681	the primary findings were as follows: There was a trend for greater improvement with combined treatment than pharmacotherapy alone.	0
209682	"Improvement was superior with combined treatment than psychotherapy alone, and the difference was moderately large such that combination treatment provided one additional positive outcome for every four patients treated with each regimen (number needed to treat of four)."	1
209683	Heterogeneity across studies was moderate.	0
209684	"Discontinuation of treatment for any reason was comparable for combined treatment, pharmacotherapy alone, and psychotherapy alone."	0
209685	"In addition, randomized trials in patients with mild to moderate major depression have demonstrated that combining antidepressants and psychotherapy is superior to either pharmacotherapy alone or psychotherapy alone."	1
209686	"Although pharmacotherapy alone is not as efficacious as combination therapy, pharmacotherapy alone is superior to placebo in patients with persistent depressive disorder: A meta-analysis of 15 randomized trials (1992 patients with dysthymic disorder) compared antidepressants with placebo and found that response (eg, reduction of baseline symptoms >=50 percent) was more likely with antidepressants (relative risk 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.7)."	1
209687	"In subgroup analyses, response was more likely with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, compared with placebo."	0
209688	"A meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials (1454 patients with dysthymic disorder treated for an average of 10 weeks) found that response was more probable with antidepressants than placebo (relative risk 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.0)."	1
209689	"A meta-analysis of 20 randomized trials (2918 patients with depression lasting at least two years) found that remission was greater with SSRIs or tricyclics than with placebo, and was comparable for SSRIs and tricyclics."	1
209690	"However, discontinuation of treatment as well as adverse effects occurred less often with SSRIs than tricyclics."	0
209691	"In addition, pharmacotherapy alone is superior to psychotherapy alone for persistent depressive disorder."	0
209692	"As an example, a meta-analysis of 8 randomized trials (1254 patients with chronic major depression or dysthymic disorder) found a significant, but clinically small effect favoring antidepressants over psychotherapy;"	1
209693	heterogeneity across studies was moderate.	0
209694	"However, psychotherapy alone is a reasonable choice for patients with persistent depressive disorder who prefer it."	1
209695	"A meta-analysis of 6 randomized trials (362 patients with chronic major depression or dysthymic disorder) found a significant, but clinically small effect favoring psychotherapy over control conditions (primarily pill placebo)."	1
209696	A subsequent trial (n = 30) found that improvement was greater in patients who received body psychotherapy (which includes both talking as well as exercises to increase body awareness) than the waiting list control.	1
209697	Randomized trials that studied interpersonal psychotherapy in patients with persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) are discussed separately.	1
209698	"Mild to moderate unipolar major depression is marked by the absence of suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior, or the presence of suicidal or homicidal ideation that does not pose an imminent risk;"	0
209699	"in addition, patients manifest no psychotic features, little to no aggressiveness, and intact judgement."	0
209700	"For the initial treatment of mild to moderate unipolar major depression, we suggest pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, rather than pharmacotherapy alone or psychotherapy alone."	0
209701	"However, pharmacotherapy alone and psychotherapy alone are reasonable alternatives."	0
209702	"Many specific antidepressant-psychotherapy combinations are available, and the superiority of any particular combination has not been established."	0
209703	"For patients with mild to moderate unipolar major depression who are initially treated with antidepressants, we suggest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) rather than other antidepressants."	1
209704	"However, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, atypical antidepressants, and serotonin modulators are reasonable alternatives."	0

209709	"There are no biologic or clinical predictors of sufficient utility to help choose between antidepressants alone and psychotherapy alone for the initial treatment of depression, or to make a selection among specific antidepressants or psychotherapies."	0
209710	Antidepressants alone have been studied and used more often than psychotherapy alone.	0
209711	"Several classes of antidepressants ) are available to treat mild to moderate unipolar major depression, and the efficacy of different antidepressants is generally comparable across and within classes."	0
209712	"Choosing a drug is thus based upon other factors, including patient response to antidepressants during prior depressive episodes, safety, side effect profile ), specific depressive symptoms, comorbid illnesses, concurrent medications and potential drug-drug interactions, family history of response to antidepressants, ease of use, patient preference, and cost."	0
209713	We typically start antidepressants at low doses ) in order to reduce side effects.	0
209714	"Among patients with mild to moderate unipolar major depression who start antidepressants, improvement is often apparent within two weeks."	1
209715	We generally treat mild to moderate unipolar major depression for 6 to 12 weeks before deciding whether antidepressants have sufficiently relieved symptoms.	0
209716	"However, for patients who show little improvement (eg, reduction of baseline symptoms <=25 percent) after 4 to 6 weeks, it is reasonable to administer next-step treatment."	1
